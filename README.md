What is this?
This is Chris Crum's dissertation repository where I (Chris) put files, R code, and occasional figures for reproducibility purposes

Can I take Chris' code?
Yes, but you do so at your own risk. I make no warranties about effectiveness outside its native environment. Use versionNEW.  

Can I use Chris' files?
Yes, definitely! 

Why are some files subject to different naming conventions that do not fit the R code in the Markdown file?
They were uploaded prior to the standardizing of the R code. It is much easier to save the file with a new name when downloading than to change the name in GitHub and commit the changes. For reproducibility purposes, the R code works with the file naming convention Leg-Place_Year.txt. If I were smart I would not have put dashes and underscores in the same name but there you go, hindsight twenty, twenty, so be warned, the R code will return NA values if you mix up - and _.
