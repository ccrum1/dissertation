# dissertation

What is this?
This is Chris Crum's dissertation repository where I (Chris) put files, R code, and occasional figures for reproducibility purposes

Can I take Chris' code?
Yes, but you do so at your own risk. I make no warranties about effectiveness outside its native environment. Use versionNEW.  

Can I use Chris' files?
Yes, definitely! 

Why are the .txt files subject to an odd naming convention?
For reproducibility purposes, the R code works with the file naming convention Leg-Place_Year.txt. If I were smart I would not have put dashes and underscores in the same name but there you go, hindsight twenty, twenty, so be warned, the R code will return NA values if you mix up - and _.
