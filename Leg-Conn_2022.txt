(c) Controllers and processors that comply with the verifiable

Sec. 4. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A consumer shall have the
right to: (1) Confirm whether or not a controller is processing the
consumer's personal data and access such personal data, unless such
confirmation or access would require the controller to reveal a trade
secret; (2) correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking
into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the
processing of the consumer's personal data; (3) delete personal data
provided by, or obtained about, the consumer; (4) obtain a copy of the
consumer's personal data processed by the controller, in a portable and,
to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the
consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance,
where the processing is carried out by automated means, provided such
controller shall not be required to reveal any trade secret; and (5) opt out




of the processing of the personal data for purposes of (A) targeted
advertising, (B) the sale of personal data, except as provided in
subsection (b) of section 6 of this act, or (C) profiling in furtherance of
solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant
effects concerning the consumer.
(b) A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and
reliable means established by the controller and described to the
consumer in the controller's privacy notice. A consumer may designate
an authorized agent in accordance with section 5 of this act to exercise
the rights of such consumer to opt out of the processing of such
consumer's personal data for purposes of subdivision (5) of subsection
(a) of this section on behalf of the consumer. In the case of processing
personal data of a known child, the parent or legal guardian may
exercise such consumer rights on the child's behalf. In the case of
processing personal data concerning a consumer subject to a
guardianship, conservatorship or other protective arrangement, the
guardian or the conservator of the consumer may exercise such rights
on the consumer's behalf.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this
act, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise
the consumer rights authorized pursuant to said sections as follows:
(1) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay,
but not later than forty-five days after receipt of the request. The
controller may extend the response period by forty-five additional days
when reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of
the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs the consumer
of any such extension within the initial forty-five-day response period
and of the reason for the extension.
(2) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's
request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay,




but not later than forty-five days after receipt of the request, of the
justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to
appeal the decision.
(3) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be
provided by a controller, free of charge, once per consumer during any
twelve-month period. If requests from a consumer are manifestly
unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the
consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of
complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The
controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded,
excessive or repetitive nature of the request.
(4) If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise any of
the rights afforded under subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of subsection
(a) of this section using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller
shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action
pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the consumer that
the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise such right
or rights until such consumer provides additional information
reasonably necessary to authenticate such consumer and such
consumer's request to exercise such right or rights. A controller shall not
be required to authenticate an opt-out request, but a controller may
deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable and
documented belief that such request is fraudulent. If a controller denies
an opt-out request because the controller believes such request is
fraudulent, the controller shall send a notice to the person who made
such request disclosing that such controller believes such request is
fraudulent, why such controller believes such request is fraudulent and
that such controller shall not comply with such request.
(5) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer
from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance
with a consumer's request to delete such data pursuant to subdivision



(3) of subsection (a) of this section by (A) retaining a record of the
deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of
ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the
controller's records and not using such retained data for any other
purpose pursuant to the provisions of sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this
act, or (B) opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal
data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant to the
provisions of sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act.
(d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the
controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period
of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process
shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for
submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later
than sixty days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the
consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the
appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.
If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer
with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which
the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.
Sec. 5. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) A consumer may designate
another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, and act on
such consumer's behalf, to opt out of the processing of such consumer's
personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in subdivision
(5) of subsection (a) of section 4 of this act. The consumer may designate
such authorized agent by way of, among other things, a technology,
including, but not limited to, an Internet link or a browser setting,
browser extension or global device setting, indicating such consumer's
intent to opt out of such processing. A controller shall comply with an
opt-out request received from an authorized agent if the controller is
able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the
consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on such




consumer's behalf.
Sec. 6. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A controller shall: (1) Limit
the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and
reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is
processed, as disclosed to the consumer; (2) except as otherwise
provided in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act, not process personal
data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to, nor
compatible with, the disclosed purposes for which such personal data is
processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains
the consumer's consent; (3) establish, implement and maintain
reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security practices
to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data
appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue; (4)
not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the
consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data
concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance
with COPPA; (5) not process personal data in violation of the laws of
this state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against
consumers; (6) provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke
the consumer's consent under this section that is at least as easy as the
mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent
and, upon revocation of such consent, cease to process the data as soon
as practicable, but not later than fifteen days after the receipt of such
request; and (7) not process the personal data of a consumer for
purposes of targeted advertising, or sell the consumer's personal data
without the consumer's consent, under circumstances where a controller
has actual knowledge, and wilfully disregards, that the consumer is at
least thirteen years of age but younger than sixteen years of age. A
controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any
of the consumer rights contained in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act,
including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates
for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods




or services to the consumer.
(b) Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to
require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the
personal data of a consumer which the controller does not collect or
maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate,
level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including
offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with
a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards,
premium features, discounts or club card program.
(c) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible,
clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes: (1) The categories of
personal data processed by the controller; (2) the purpose for processing
personal data; (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights,
including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with
regard to the consumer's request; (4) the categories of personal data that
the controller shares with third parties, if any; (5) the categories of third
parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data; and (6)
an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the
consumer may use to contact the controller.
(d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes
personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and
conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which
a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing.
(e) (1) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy
notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit
a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to sections 1 to 11,
inclusive, of this act. Such means shall take into account the ways in
which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for
secure and reliable communication of such requests and the ability of
the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request.




A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new account in
order to exercise consumer rights, but may require a consumer to use an
existing account. Any such means shall include:
(A) (i) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's
Internet web site to an Internet web page that enables a consumer, or an
agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising or sale of
the consumer's personal data; and
(ii) Not later than January 1, 2025, allowing a consumer to opt out of
any processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of
targeted advertising, or any sale of such personal data, through an optout preference signal sent, with such consumer's consent, by a platform,
technology or mechanism to the controller indicating such consumer's
intent to opt out of any such processing or sale. Such platform,
technology or mechanism shall:
(I) Not unfairly disadvantage another controller;
(II) Not make use of a default setting, but, rather, require the
consumer to make an affirmative, freely given and unambiguous choice
to opt out of any processing of such consumer's personal data pursuant
to sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act;
(III) Be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the average consumer;
(IV) Be as consistent as possible with any other similar platform,
technology or mechanism required by any federal or state law or
regulation; and
(V) Enable the controller to accurately determine whether the
consumer is a resident of this state and whether the consumer has made
a legitimate request to opt out of any sale of such consumer's personal
data or targeted advertising.



(B) If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the
consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or
any sale of such personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent
in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this
subdivision conflicts with the consumer's existing controller-specific
privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller's bona fide
loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program, the
controller shall comply with such consumer's opt-out preference signal
but may notify such consumer of such conflict and provide to such
consumer the choice to confirm such controller-specific privacy setting
or participation in such program.
(2) If a controller responds to consumer opt‐out requests received
pursuant to subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection by
informing the consumer of a charge for the use of any product or service,
the controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for the retention, use, sale or
sharing of the consumer's personal data.
Sec. 7. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A processor shall adhere to
the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting
the controller's obligations under sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act.
Such assistance shall include: (1) Taking into account the nature of
processing and the information available to the processor, by
appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is
reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to
consumer rights requests; (2) taking into account the nature of
processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting
the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the
security of processing the personal data and in relation to the
notification of a breach of security, as defined in section 36a-701b of the
general statutes, of the system of the processor, in order to meet the
controller's obligations; and (3) providing necessary information to



enable the controller to conduct and document data protection
assessments.
(b) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the
processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing
performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and
clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose
of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of
processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract
shall also require that the processor: (1) Ensure that each person
processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with
respect to the data; (2) at the controller's direction, delete or return all
personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision
of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (3)
upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the
controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the
processor's compliance with the obligations in sections 1 to 11, inclusive,
of this act; (4) after providing the controller an opportunity to object,
engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires
the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect
to the personal data; and (5) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable
assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor, or
the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to
conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and
organizational measures in support of the obligations under sections 1
to 11, inclusive, of this act, using an appropriate and accepted control
standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments.
The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller
upon request.
(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or
processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by
virtue of such controller's or processor's role in the processing



relationship, as described in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act.
(d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or
processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based
determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is
to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person's processing
of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to
adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with
respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to
adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing
of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or
jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the
processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to
such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under
section 11 of this act.
Sec. 8. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A controller shall conduct and
document a data protection assessment for each of the controller's
processing activities that presents a heightened risk of harm to a
consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a
heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes: (1) The processing of
personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; (2) the sale of
personal data; (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of
profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of
(A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on,
consumers, (B) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers,
(C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the
private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would
be offensive to a reasonable person, or (D) other substantial injury to
consumers; and (4) the processing of sensitive data.
(b) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a)
of this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow,
directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the




consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks
to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as
mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to
reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any such data
protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable
expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and
the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose
personal data will be processed.
(c) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any
data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation
conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the
data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The
Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment for
compliance with the responsibilities set forth in sections 1 to 11,
inclusive, of this act. Data protection assessments shall be confidential
and shall be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information
Act, as defined in section 1-200 of the general statutes. To the extent any
information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the
Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client
privilege or work product protection, such disclosure shall not
constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.
(d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable
set of processing operations that include similar activities.
(e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the
purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the
data protection assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements
established in this section if such data protection assessment is
reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment
that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
(f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing




activities created or generated after July 1, 2023, and are not retroactive.
Sec. 9. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) Any controller in possession
of de-identified data shall: (1) Take reasonable measures to ensure that
the data cannot be associated with an individual; (2) publicly commit to
maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to reidentify the data; and (3) contractually obligate any recipients of the deidentified data to comply with all provisions of sections 1 to 11,
inclusive, of this act.
(b) Nothing in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
to: (1) Require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data
or pseudonymous data; or (2) maintain data in identifiable form, or
collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology, in order to be
capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal
data.
(c) Nothing in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated
consumer rights request if the controller: (1) Is not reasonably capable
of associating the request with the personal data or it would be
unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request
with the personal data; (2) does not use the personal data to recognize
or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal
data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the
same specific consumer; and (3) does not sell the personal data to any
third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any
third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this
section.
(d) The rights afforded under subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive, of
subsection (a) of section 4 of this act shall not apply to pseudonymous
data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate that any
information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is


subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the
controller from accessing such information.
(e) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified
data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any
contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or deidentified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any
breaches of those contractual commitments.
Sec. 10. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) Nothing in sections 1 to 11,
inclusive, of this act shall be construed to restrict a controller's or
processor's ability to: (1) Comply with federal, state or municipal
ordinances or regulations; (2) comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory
inquiry, investigation, subpoena or summons by federal, state,
municipal or other governmental authorities; (3) cooperate with law
enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller
or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal,
state or municipal ordinances or regulations; (4) investigate, establish,
exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims; (5) provide a product or
service specifically requested by a consumer; (6) perform under a
contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of
a written warranty; (7) take steps at the request of a consumer prior to
entering into a contract; (8) take immediate steps to protect an interest
that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or another
individual, and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on
another legal basis; (9) prevent, detect, protect against or respond to
security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or
deceptive activities or any illegal activity, preserve the integrity or
security of systems or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible
for any such action; (10) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or
statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other
applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored and
governed by an institutional review board that determines, or similar


independent oversight entities that determine, (A) whether the deletion
of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
exclusively accrue to the controller, (B) the expected benefits of the
research outweigh the privacy risks, and (C) whether the controller has
implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated
with research, including any risks associated with re-identification; (11)
assist another controller, processor or third party with any of the
obligations under sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act; or (12) process
personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health,
community health or population health, but solely to the extent that
such processing is (A) subject to suitable and specific measures to
safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data is being
processed, and (B) under the responsibility of a professional subject to
confidentiality obligations under federal, state or local law.
(b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall not restrict a controller's or
processor's ability to collect, use or retain data for internal use to: (1)
Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products,
services or technology; (2) effectuate a product recall; (3) identify and
repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
(4) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the
expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the
consumer's existing relationship with the controller, or are otherwise
compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a
product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the
performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
(c) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall not apply where compliance
by the controller or processor with said sections would violate an
evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state. Nothing in sections 1
to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed to prevent a controller or


processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a
person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state
as part of a privileged communication.
(d) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a
processor or third-party controller in accordance with sections 1 to 11,
inclusive, of this act shall not be deemed to have violated said sections
if the processor or third-party controller that receives and processes
such personal data violates said sections, provided, at the time the
disclosing controller or processor disclosed such personal data, the
disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that
the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate said
sections. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data
from a controller or processor in compliance with sections 1 to 11,
inclusive, of this act is likewise not in violation of said sections for the
transgressions of the controller or processor from which such thirdparty controller or processor receives such personal data.
(e) Nothing in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
to: (1) Impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely
affects the rights or freedoms of any person, including, but not limited
to, the rights of any person (A) to freedom of speech or freedom of the
press guaranteed in the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution, or (B) under section 52-146t of the general statutes; or (2)
apply to any person's processing of personal data in the course of such
person's purely personal or household activities.
(f) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section
may be processed to the extent that such processing is: (1) Reasonably
necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
(2) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or
retained pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall, where
applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such


collection, use or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable
administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data and to
reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to
such collection, use or retention of personal data.
(g) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption
in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that
such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the
requirements in subsection (f) of this section.
(h) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in
this section shall not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect
to such processing.
Sec. 11. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) The Attorney General shall
have exclusive authority to enforce violations of sections 1 to 10,
inclusive, of this act.
(b) During the period beginning on July 1, 2023, and ending on
December 31, 2024, the Attorney General shall, prior to initiating any
action for a violation of any provision of sections 1 to 10, inclusive, of
this act, issue a notice of violation to the controller if the Attorney
General determines that a cure is possible. If the controller fails to cure
such violation within sixty days of receipt of the notice of violation, the
Attorney General may bring an action pursuant to this section. Not later
than February 1, 2024, the Attorney General shall submit a report, in
accordance with section 11-4a of the general statutes, to the joint
standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of
matters relating to general law disclosing: (1) The number of notices of
violation the Attorney General has issued; (2) the nature of each
violation; (3) the number of violations that were cured during the sixtyday cure period; and (4) any other matter the Attorney General deems
relevant for the purposes of such report.


(c) Beginning on January 1, 2025, the Attorney General may, in
determining whether to grant a controller or processor the opportunity
to cure an alleged violation described in subsection (b) of this section,
consider: (1) The number of violations; (2) the size and complexity of the
controller or processor; (3) the nature and extent of the controller's or
processor's processing activities; (4) the substantial likelihood of injury
to the public; (5) the safety of persons or property; and (6) whether such
alleged violation was likely caused by human or technical error.
(d) Nothing in sections 1 to 10, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
as providing the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of action for
violations of said sections or any other law.
(e) A violation of the requirements of sections 1 to 10, inclusive, of
this act shall constitute an unfair trade practice for purposes of section
42-110b of the general statutes and shall be enforced solely by the
Attorney General, provided the provisions of section 42-110g of the
general statutes shall not apply to such violation.
Sec. 12. (Effective from passage) (a) Not later than September 1, 2022,
the chairpersons of the joint standing committee of the General
Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to general law shall
convene a task force to study:
(1) Information sharing among health care providers and social care
providers and make recommendations to eliminate health disparities
and inequities across sectors, as described in subsection (a) of section
19a-133b of the general statutes;
(2) Algorithmic decision-making and make recommendations
concerning the proper use of data to reduce bias in such decisionmaking;
(3) Possible legislation that would require an operator, as defined in
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 USC 6501 et seq., as


amended from time to time, to, upon a parent's request, delete the
account of a child and cease to collect, use or maintain, in retrievable
form, the child's personal data on the operator's Internet web site or
online service directed to children, and provide parents with an
accessible, reasonable and verifiable means to make such a request;
(4) Any means available to verify the age of a child who creates a
social media account;
(5) Issues concerning data colocation, including, but not limited to,
the impact that the provisions of sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act
have on third parties that provide data storage and colocation services;
(6) Possible legislation that would expand the provisions of sections
1 to 11, inclusive, of this act to include additional persons or groups; and
(7) Other topics concerning data privacy.
(b) The chairpersons of the joint standing committee of the General
Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to general law shall
serve as the chairpersons of the task force, and shall jointly appoint the
members of the task force. Such members shall include, but need not be
limited to:
(1) Representatives from business, academia, consumer advocacy
groups, small and large companies and the office of the Attorney
General; and
(2) Attorneys with experience in privacy law.
(c) The administrative staff of the joint standing committee of the
General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to general law
shall serve as administrative staff of the task force.

on its findings and recommendations to the joint standing committee of


the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to general
law, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-4a of the general
statutes. The task force shall terminate on the date that it submits such
report or January 1, 2023, whichever is later.
