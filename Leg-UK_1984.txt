in writing whether his application has been accepted or refused ;
and where the Registrar notifies an applicant that his applica-
tion has been accepted the notification shall contain a statement
of-
      (a)  the particulars entered in the register, or the alteration
             made, in pursuance of the application ; and
       (b) the date on which the particulars were entered or the
             alteration was made.
    (2) The Registrar shall not refuse an application made in
 accordance with section 6 above unless-
      (a) he considers that the particulars proposed for registra-
            tion or, as the case may be, the particulars that would
            result from the proposed alteration, will not give suffic-
            ient information as to the matters to which they relate ;
            or
      (b) he is satisfied that the applicant is likely to contravene
             any of the data protection principles ; or
      (c) he considers that the information available to him is
             insufficient to satisfy him that the applicant is unlikely
             to contravene any of those principles.
   (3) Subsection (2)(a) above shall not be construed as preclu-
ding the acceptance by the Registrar of particulars expressed in
general terms in cases where that is appropriate, and the Regis-
trar shall accept particulars expressed in such terms in any case
in which he is satisfied that more specific particulars would be
likely to prejudice the purpose or purposes for which the data
are to be held.
   (4) Where the Registrar refuses an application under this
section he shall give his reasons and inform the applicant of the
rights of appeal conferred by section 13 below.
   (5) If in any case it appears to the Registrar that an applica-
tion needs more consideration than can be given to it in the
period mentioned in subsection (1) above he shall as soon as
practicable and in any case before the end of that period notify
the applicant in writing to that effect ; and in that event no noti-
fication need be given under that subsection until after the end
of that period.
   (6) Subject to subsection (8) below, a person who has made an
application in accordance with section 6 above shall-
      (a) until he receives a notification in respect of it under sub-
            section (1) above or the application is withdrawn;
           and

          (b)                            under that subsection of the
                              if he receives a notification
                          refusal of his application, until the end of the period
                          within which an appeal can be brought against the re-
                          fusal and, if an appeal is brought, until the determina-
                         tion or withdrawal of the appeal,
                be treated for the purposes of section 5 above as if his applica-
                tion had been accepted and the particulars contained in it had
                been entered in the register or, as the case may be, the alteration
                requested in the application had been made on the date on
                which the application was made.
                  (7)    If
                          by reason of special circumstances the Registrar con-
                siders that   a refusal notified by him to an applicant under sub-
                section (1) above should take effect as a matter of urgency he
                may include a statement to that effect in the notification of the
                refusal ; and in that event subsection (6)(b) above shall have
                effect as if for the words from " the period " onwards there were
                substituted the words " the period of seven days beginning with
                the date on which that notification is received ".

                    (8) Subsection (6) above shall not apply to an application
                made by any person if in the previous two years-
                       (a) an application by that person has been refused under
                            this section ; or
                       (b) all or any of the particulars constituting an entry con-
                            tained in the register in respect of that person have
                            been removed in pursuance of a de-registration notice ;
                but in the case of any such application subsection (1) above shall
                apply as if for the reference to six months there were substituted
                a reference to two months and, where the Registrar gives a noti-
                fication under subsection (5) above in respect of any such appli-
                cation, subsection (6) above shall apply to it as if for the reference
                to the date on which the application was made there were sub-
                stituted a reference to the date on which that notification is
                received.

                  (9) For the purposes of subsection (6) above an application
                shall be treated as made or withdrawn-
                      (a) if the application or notice of withdrawal is sent by
                            registered post or the recorded delivery service, on the
                            date on which it is received for dispatch by the Post
                            Office ;
                      (b) in any other case, on the date on which it is received
                            by the Registrar ;
                and for the purposes of subsection (8)(a) above an application
                shall not be treated as having been refused so long as an appeal
                against the refusal can be brought, while such an appeal is
                pending or if such an appeal has been allowed.


  8.-(1) No entry shall be retained in the register after the PART II
expiration of the initial period of registration except in pur- Duration and
suance of a renewal application made to the Registrar in renewal of
accordance with this section.                                   registration.

   (2) Subject to subsection (3) below, the initial period of regis-
tration and the period for which an entry is to be retained in
pursuance of a renewal application (" the renewal period ") shall
be such period (not being less than three years) as may be pre-
scribed beginning with the date on which the entry in question
was made or, as the case may be, the date on which that entry
would fall to be removed if the renewal application had not been
made.
   (3) The person making an application for registration or a re-
newal application may in his application specify as the initial
period of registration or, as the case may be, as the renewal
period, a period shorter than that prescribed, being a period con-
sisting of one or more complete years.
   (4) Where the Registrar notifies an applicant for registration
that his application has been accepted the notification shall in-
clude a statement of the date when the initial period of registra-
tion will expire.
   (5) Every renewal application shall be accompanied by the
prescribed fee, and no such application shall be made except in
the period of six months ending with the expiration of-
      (a) the initial period of registration ; or
      (b) if there have been one or more previous renewal appli-
           cations, the current renewal period.
   (6) Any renewal application may be sent by post, and the
Registrar shall acknowledge its receipt and notify the applicant
in writing of the date until which the entry in question will be
retained in the register in pursuance of the application.
   (7) Without prejudice to the foregoing provisions of this sec-
tion, the Registrar may at any time remove an entry from the
register at the request of the person to whom the entry relates.
                                                                  
  9.-(1)    The Registrar shall provide facilities for making the information contained in the entries
in the register available for inspection (in visible and legible form) by members of 
the public at all reasonable hours and free of charge. 

   (2) The Registrar shall, on payment of such fee, if any, as may
be prescribed, supply any member of the public with a duly
certified copy in writing of the particulars contained in the entry
made in the register in pursuance of any application for registra-
tion.

                             Supervision
       10.-(1) If the Registrar is satisfied that a registered person
       has contravened or is contravening any of the data protection
                 principles he may serve him with a notice (" an enforcement
                 notice ") requiring him to take, within such time as is specified
                 in the notice, such steps as are so specified for complying with
                 the principle or principles in question.
                   (2)    In deciding whether to serve an enforcement notice the
                 Registrar  shall consider whether the contravention has caused or
                 is likely to cause any person damage or distress.
                   (3) An enforcement notice in respect of a contravention of
                 the fifth data protection principle may require the data user-
                       (a) to rectify or erase the data and any other data held by
                            him and containing an expression of opinion which
                             appears to the Registrar to be based on the inaccurate
                             data ; or
                       (b) in the case of such data as are mentioned in subsection
                             (2) of section 22 below, either to take the steps men-
                             tioned in paragraph (a) above or to take such steps as
                             are specified in the notice for securing compliance with
                             the requirements specified in that subsection and, if
                             the Registrar thinks fit, for supplementing the data with
                            such statement of the true facts relating to the matters
                             dealt with by the data as the Registrar may approve.
                    (4) The Registrar shall not serve an enforcement notice requir-
                 ing the person served with the notice to take steps for comply-
                 ing with paragraph (a) of the seventh data protection principle in
                 respect of any data subject unless satisfied that the person has
                 contravened section 21 below by failing to supply information
                 to which the data subject is entitled and which has been duly
                 requested in accordance with that section.
                    (5)   An enforcement notice shall contain-
                         (a) a statement   of the principle or principles which the
                              Registrar is satisfied have been or are being contra-
                              vened and his reasons for reaching that conclusion ;
                              and
                         (b) particulars of the rights of appeal conferred by section
                              13 below.

                    (6) Subject to subsection (7) below, the time specified in an
                 enforcement notice for taking the steps which it requires shall
                 not expire before the end of the period within which an appeal
                 can be brought against the notice and, if such an appeal is
                 brought, those steps need not be taken pending the determination
                 or withdrawal of the appeal.


   (7) If by reason of special circumstances the Registrar con-        
siders that the steps required by an enforcement notice should
be taken as a matter of urgency he may include a statement to
that effect in the notice ; and in that event subsection (6) above
shall not apply but the notice shall not require the steps to be
taken before the end of the period of seven days beginning with
the date on which the notice is served.
   (8) The Registrar may cancel an enforcement notice by written
notification to the person on whom it was served.
   (9) Any person who fails to comply with an enforcement notice
shall be guilty of an offence ; but it shall be a defence for a
person charged with an offence under this subsection to prove
that he exercised all due diligence to comply with the notice in
question.

   11.-(1) If the Registrar is satisfied that a registered person
has contravened or is contravening any of the data protection principles he may-
      (a) serve him with a notice (" a de-registration notice ") stat-
           ing that he proposes, at the expiration of such period
           as is specified in the notice, to remove from the register
           all or any of the particulars constituting the entry or
           any of the entries contained in the register in respect
           of that person ; and
      (b) subject to the provisions of this section, remove those
           particulars from the register at the expiration of that
           period.
   (2) In deciding whether to serve a de-registration notice the
Registrar shall consider whether the contravention has caused
or is likely to cause any person damage or distress, and the Regis-
trar shall not serve such a notice unless he is satisfied that com-
pliance with the principle or principles in question cannot be
adequately secured by the service of an enforcement notice.
   (3) A de-registration notice shall contain-
      (a) a statement of the principle or principles which the
           Registrar is satisfied have been or are being con-
           travened and his reasons for reaching that conclu-
           sion and deciding that compliance cannot be ade-
           quately secured by the service of an enforcement notice ;
           and
      (b) particulars of the rights of appeal conferred by section
           13 below.
   (4) Subject to subsection (5) below, the period specified
                                                                 in a
de-registration notice pursuant to subsection (1)(a) above shall
not expire before the end of the period within which an appeal


       can be brought against the notice and, if such an appeal is
                 brought, the particulars shall not be removed pending the deter-
                 mination or withdrawal of the appeal.
                    (5) If by reason of special circumstances the Registrar con-
                 siders that any particulars should be removed from the register
                 as a matter of urgency he may include a statement to that effect
                 in the de-registration notice ; and in that event subsection (4)
                 above shall not apply but the particulars shall not be removed
                 before the end of the period of seven days beginning with the
                 date on which the notice is served.
                   (6) The Registrar may cancel a de-registration notice by written
                 notification to the person on whom it was served.
                    (7) References in this section to removing any particulars
                 include references to restricting any description which forms
                 part of any particulars.

            12.-(1) If it appears to the Registrar that-
             (a) a person registered as a data user or as a data user who
                              also carries on a computer bureau ; or
                         (b) a person treated as so registered by virtue of section
                           7(6) above,
                 proposes to transfer personal data held by him to a place outside
                 the United Kingdom, the Registrar may, if satisfied as to the
                 matters mentioned in subsection (2) or (3) below, serve that
                 person with a notice (" a transfer prohibition notice ") prohibit-
                 ing him from transferring the data either absolutely or until he
                 has taken such steps as are specified in the notice for protecting
                 the interests of the data subjects in question.
                    (2) Where the place to which the data are to be transferred
                 is not in a State bound by the European Convention the Regis-
                 trar must be satisfied that the transfer is likely to contravene,
                 or lead to      a   contravention of, any of the data protection prin-
                 ciples.
                    (3) Where the place to which the data are to be transferred is
                 in a State bound by the European Convention the Registrar
                 must be satisfied      either-
                         (a)   that-
                                    (i) the person in question intends to give instruc-
                                 tions for the further transfer of the data to a place
                                 which is not in such a State ; and
                                    (ii) that the further transfer is likely to contravene,
                                 or lead to a contravention of, any of the data pro-
                                 tection principles ; or
                         (b) in the case of data to which an order under section 2(3)
                               above applies, that the transfer is likely to contravene
            or lead to a contravention of, any of the data protec-     
            tion principles as they have effect in relation to such
            data.
   (4) In deciding whether to serve a transfer prohibition notice
the Registrar shall consider whether the notice is required for
preventing damage or distress to any person and shall have
regard to the general desirability of facilitating the free transfer
of data between the United Kingdom and other states and terri-
tories.
   (5) A transfer prohibition notice shall specify the time when it
is to take effect and contain-
      (a) a statement of the principle or principles which the
           Registrar is satisfied are likely to be contravened and
           his reasons for reaching that conclusion ; and
      (b) particulars of the rights of appeal conferred by section
            13   below.
   (6) Subject to subsection (7) below, the time specified in a
transfer prohibition notice pursuant to subsection (5) above
shall not be before the end of the period within which an appeal
can be brought against the notice and, if such an appeal is
brought, the notice shall not take effect pending the determina-
tion or withdrawal of the appeal.
   (7) If by reason of special circumstances the Registrar con-
siders that the prohibition should take effect as a matter of
urgency he may include a statement to that effect in the transfer
prohibition notice; and in that event subsection (6) above shall
not apply but the notice shall not take effect before the end of
the period of seven days beginning with the date on which the
notice is served.
   (8) The Registrar may cancel a transfer prohibition notice
by written notification to the person on whom it was served.
   (9) No transfer prohibition notice shall prohibit the transfer
of any data where the transfer of the information constituting
the data is required or authorised by or under any enactment
or required by any convention or other instrument imposing an
international obligation on the United Kingdom.
   (10) Any person who contravenes a transfer prohibition notice
shall be guilty of an offence ; but it shall be a defence for a
person charged with an offence under this subsection to prove
that he exercised all due diligence to avoid a contravention of
the notice in question.
        For the purposes of this section a place shall be treated
     (11)
as in a State bound by the European Convention if it is in any
territory in respect of which the State is bound.

                                    Appeals
          13.-(1) A person may appeal to the Tribunal against-
                         (a) any refusal by the Registrar of an application by
                            person for registration or for the alteration of regi-
                            stered particulars ;
                       (b) any enforcement notice, de-registration notice or transfer

                    (2) Where a notification that an application has been refused
                 contains a statement by the Registrar in accordance with section
                 7(7) above, then, whether or not the applicant appeals under
                 paragraph (a) of subsection (1) above, he may appeal against the
                 Registrar's decision to include that statement in the notification.
                    (3) Where any such notice as is mentioned in paragraph
                 (b) of subsection (1) above contains a statement by the Registrar

       14.-(l) If on an appeal under section 13(1) above the Tribunal considers-
                       (a) that the refusal or notice against which the appeal is
                            brought is not in accordance with the law ; or
                       (b) to the extent that the refusal or notice involved an
                            exercise of discretion by the Registrar, that he ought to
                            have exercised his discretion differently,
                 the Tribunal shall allow the appeal or substitute such other
                 decision or notice as could have been made or served by the
                 Registrar ; and in any other case the Tribunal shall dismiss the
                 appeal.

                    (3) On an appeal under subsection (2) of section 13 above
                 the Tribunal may direct that the notification of the refusal shall
                 be treated as if it did not contain any such statement as is
                 mentioned in that subsection.
                    (4) On an appeal under subsection (3) of section 13 above the
                 Tribunal may direct that the notice in question shall have
                 effect as if it did not contain any such statement as is mentioned
                 in that subsection or that the inclusion of the statement shall
not have effect in relation to any part of the notice and may            
make such modifications in the notice as may be required for
giving effect to the direction.
  (5) Any party to an appeal to the Tribunal may appeal from
the decision of the Tribunal on a point of law to the appropriate
court ; and that court shall be-

   21.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, an individual shall be entitled-                                       
     (a) to be informed by any data user whether the data
          held by him include personal data of which that indi-
          vidual is the data subject ; and
     (b) to be supplied by any data user with a copy of the in-
          formation constituting any such personal data held
          by him ;
and where any of the information referred to in paragraph (b)
above is expressed in terms which are not intelligible without
explanation the information shall be accompanied by an explana-
tion of those terms.
   (2) A data user shall not be obliged to supply any informa-
tion under subsection (1) above except in response to a request


     PART   III   in writing and on payment of such fee (not exceeding the pre-
                  scribed maximum) as he may require ; but a request for informa-
                  tion under both paragraphs of that subsection shall be treated
                  as a single request and a request for information under para-
                  graph (a) shall, in the absence of any indication to the contrary,
                  be treated as extending also to information under paragraph
                  (b).
                     (3) In the case of a data user having separate entries in the
                  register in respect of data held for different purposes a separate
                  request must be made and a separate fee paid under this section
                  in respect of the data to which each entry relates.
                     (4) A data user shall not be obliged to comply with a request
                  under this section-
                        (a) unless he is supplied with such information as he may
                             reasonably require in order to satisfy himself as to the
                             identity of the person making the request and to locate
                             the information which he seeks ; and
                        (b) if he cannot comply with the request without disclosing
                             information relating to another individual who can be
                             identified from that information, unless he is satisfied
                             that the other individual has consented to the disclosure
                             of the information to the person making the request.
                     (5) In paragraph (b) of subsection (4) above the reference to
                  information relating to another individual includes a reference
                  to information identifying that individual as the source of the
                  information sought by the request ; and that paragraph shall
                  not be construed as excusing a data user from supplying so
                  much of the information sought by the request as can be
                  supplied without disclosing the identity of the other individual
                  concerned, whether by the omission of names or other identify-
                  ing particulars or otherwise.
                     (6) A data user shall comply with a request under this sec-
                  tion within forty days of receiving the request or, if later, re-
                  ceiving the information referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection
                  (4) above and, in a case where it is required, the consent referred
                  to in paragraph (b) of that subsection.
                     (7) The information to be supplied pursuant to a request
                  under this section shall be supplied by reference to the data in
                   question at the time when the request is received except that it
                   may take account of any amendment or deletion made between
                   that time and the time when the information is supplied, being
                  an amendment or deletion that would have been made regard-
                  less of the receipt of the request.
                    (8) If a court is satisfied on the application of any person who
                  has made a request under the foregoing provisions of this section
that the data user in question has failed to comply with the           
request in contravention of those provisions, the court may
order him to comply with the request ; but a court shall not
make an order under this subsection if it considers that it would
in all the circumstances be unreasonable to do so, whether be-
cause of the frequency with which the applicant has made re-
quests to the data user under those provisions or for any other
reason.
  (9) The Secretary of State may by order provide for enabling
a requestunder this section to be made on behalf of any indi-
vidual who is incapable by reason of mental disorder of manag-

third party, subsection (1) above does not apply if the following
requirements have been complied with-
     (a) the data indicate that the information was received or
          obtained as aforesaid or the information has not been
          extracted from the data except in a form which includes
          an indication to that effect ; and
     (b) if the data subject has notified the data user that he
          regards the information as incorrect or misleading, an
          indication to that effect has been included in the data
          or the information has not been extracted from the data
          except in a form which includes an indication to that
            effect.
  (3) In proceedings brought against any person by virtue of
this
section it shall be a defence to prove that he had taken such
care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to en-
sure the accuracy of the data at the material time.
   (4) Data are inaccurate for the purposes
of this section if incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact.

                                                           
  23.-(1) An individual who is the subject of personal data held by a data user
or in respect of which services are provided by a person carrying on a computer bureau and who suffers
damage by reason of-
    (a) the loss of the data ;
    (b) the destruction of the data without the authority of the data user or, as the case may be,
of the person carrying on the bureau; or 
(c) subject to subsection (2) below, the disclosure of the 
                            data, or access having been obtained to the data, with-
                            out such authority as aforesaid,
                  shall be entitled to compensation from the data user or, as the
                  case may be, the person carrying on the bureau for that damage
                  and for any distress which the individual has suffered by reason
                  of the loss, destruction, disclosure or access.
                     (2) In the case of a registered data user, subsection (1)(c)
                  above does not apply to disclosure to, or access by, any person
                  falling within a description specified pursuant to section 4(3)(d)
                  above in an entry in the register relating to that data user.
                    (3)     In proceedings brought against any person by virtue of
                  this section       it shall    be a defence to prove that he had taken
                  such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required
                  to prevent the loss, destruction, disclosure or access in question.
       24.-(l) If   a court is satisfied on the application of a data
      subject that personal data held by a data user of which the appli-
                  cant is the subject are inaccurate 'within the meaning of section
                  22 above, the court may order the rectification or erasure of the
                  data and of any data held by the data user and containing an
                  expression of opinion which appears to the court to be based
                  on the inaccurate data.
                    (2) Subsection (1) above applies whether or not the data
                  accurately record information received or obtained by the data
                  user from the data subject or a third party but where the data
                  accurately record such information, then-
                       (a) if the requirements mentioned in section 22(2) above
                             have been complied with, the court may, instead of
                             making an order under subsection (1) above, make an
                             order requiring the data to be supplemented by such
                             statement of the true facts relating to the matters dealt
                             with by the data as the court may approve ; and
                       (b) if all or any of those requirements have not been com-
                             plied with, the court may, instead of making an order
                             under that subsection, make such order as it thinks fit
                            for securing compliance with those requirements with
                             or without a further order requiring the data to be
                             supplemented by such a statement as is mentioned in
                             paragraph (a) above.
                     (3)   If a court is satisfied on the application of a data subject-
                           (a)   that he has suffered damage by reason of the disclosure
                                   of personal data, or of access having been obtained to
                                   personal data, in circumstances entitling him to com-
                                  pensation under section 23 above ; and


    (b)  that there is a substantial risk of further disclosure of     
          or access to the data without such authority as is men-
          tioned in that section,
the court may order the erasure of the data ; but, in the case of
data in respect of which services were being provided by a person
carrying on a computer bureau, the court shall not make such an
order unless such steps as are reasonably practicable have been
taken for notifying the person for whom those services were pro-
vided and giving him an opportunity to be heard.

   25.-(1) The jurisdiction conferred by sections 21 and 24 Jurisdiction
above shall be exercisable by the High Court or a county court and procedure.
or, in Scotland, by the Court of Session or the sheriff.
   (2) For the purpose of determining any question whether an
applicant under subsection (8) of section 21 above is entitled
to the information which he seeks (including any question
whether any relevant data are exempt from that section by
virtue of Part IV of this Act) a court may require the informa-
tion constituting any data held by the data user to be made

                reasonable intervals regard shall be had to the nature of the data, the
                purpose for which the data are held and the frequency with which
                the data are altered.
                   (3) The correction or erasure of personal data is appropriate
                only where necessary for ensuring compliance with the other data

                  6. Regard shall be   had-
                    (a)   to the nature of the personal data and the harm that would

                           truction as are mentioned in this principle ; and


     (b) to the place where the personal data are stored, to security

   7. Where personal       data are held for historical, statistical m
research purposes and not used in such a way that damage or distress
is, or is likely to be, caused to any data subject-
     (a) the information contained in the data shall not be regarded
           for the purposes of the first principle as obtained unfairly
           by reason only that its use for any such purpose was not
