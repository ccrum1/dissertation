34 of a request submitted pursuant to the methods described in
35 this section. The response period may be extended once by
1 forty-five additional days when reasonably necessary upon

3 requests by informing the consumer of any such extension within
4 the initial ninety-day response period, together with the
5 reason for the extension.
6
b. If a controller declines to take action regarding the
7 consumer’s request, the controller shall inform the consumer
8 without undue delay of the justification for declining to take
9 action, except in the case of a suspected fraudulent request,
10 in which case the controller may state that the controller was
11 unable to authenticate the request. The controller shall also
12 provide instructions for appealing the decision pursuant to
13 subsection 3.
14
c. Information provided in response to a consumer request
15 shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to
16 twice annually per consumer. If a request from a consumer
17 is manifestly unfounded, excessive, repetitive, technically
18 unfeasible, or the controller reasonably believes that the

19 primary purpose of the request is not to exercise a consumer
20 right, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee
21 to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request
22 or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the
23 burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive,
24 repetitive, or technically unfeasible nature of the request.
25
d. If a controller is unable to authenticate a request
26 using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall
27 not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action
28 under this section and may request that the consumer provide

30 consumer and the consumer’s request.

32 to appeal the controller’s refusal to take action on a request
33 within a reasonable period of time after the consumer’s
34 receipt of the decision pursuant to this section. The appeal

1 process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant
2 to this section. Within sixty days of receipt of an appeal,
3 a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any
4 action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including
5 a written explanation of the reasons for the decision. If
6 the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the

15 issue.
16
2. A controller shall not process sensitive data collected
17 from a consumer for a nonexempt purpose without the consumer
18 having been presented with clear notice and an opportunity to

28 goods or services, charging different prices or rates for
29 goods or services, or providing a different level of quality
30 of goods and services to the consumer. However, nothing in
31 this chapter shall be construed to require a controller to
32 provide a product or service that requires the personal data
33 of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain
34 or to prohibit a controller from offering a different price,
35 rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a
1 consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee,
2 if the consumer has exercised the consumer’s right to opt
3 out pursuant to section 715D.3 or the offer is related to a
4 consumer’s voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty,
5 rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program.
6
4. Any provision of a contract or agreement that purports to
7 waive or limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to section

27 out of such activity.
28
7. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in
29 a privacy notice, secure and reliable means for consumers to
30 submit a request to exercise their consumer rights under this
31 chapter. Such means shall consider the ways in which consumers
32 normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and
33 reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of
34 the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer
35 making the request. A controller shall not require a consumer
1 to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights
2 pursuant to section 715D.3, but may require a consumer to use
3 an existing account.
Sec. 5. NEW SECTION. 715D.5 Processor duties.
4
5
1. A processor shall assist a controller in duties
6 required under this chapter, taking into account the nature of

17 govern the processor’s data processing procedures with respect

24 following:
25
a. Ensure that each person processing personal data is
26 subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data.

1 contract in accordance with this section that requires the

3. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a
5 controller or a processor from imposed liabilities by virtue
6 of the controller or processor’s role in the processing

9 processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a
10 fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which
11 personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues
12 to adhere to a controller’s instructions with respect to a
13 specific processing of personal data remains a processor.

1 third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data

10 identifiable natural person.
11
4. Controllers that disclose pseudonymous data or

17 following:
18
(1) If the deletion of the information is likely to provide
19 substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the
20 controller.
21
(2) The expected benefits of the research outweigh the

30 processor’s ability to collect, use, or retain data as follows:
31
a. To conduct internal research to develop, improve, or
32 repair products, services, or technology.
33

7 child or the performance of a contract to which the consumer or
8 parent or guardian of a child is a party.
9
3. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors
10 under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by the
11 controller or processor with this chapter would violate an
12 evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state. Nothing
13 in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a controller or
14 processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to
15 a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of
16 the state as part of a privileged communication.
17
4. A controller or processor that discloses personal data
18 to a third-party controller or processor, in compliance with
19 the requirements of this chapter, is not in violation of
20 this chapter if the third-party controller or processor that
21 receives and processes such personal data is in violation of
22 this chapter, provided that, at the time of disclosing the
23 personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not
24 have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a
25 violation. A third-party controller or processor receiving
26 personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with
27 the requirements of this chapter is likewise not in violation
28 of this chapter for the offenses of the controller or processor
29 from which it receives such personal data.
30
5. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as an
31 obligation imposed on a controller or a processor that
32 adversely affects the privacy or other rights or freedoms
33 of any persons, such as exercising the right of free speech
34 pursuant to the first amendment to the United States
35 Constitution, or applies to personal data by a person in the
1 course of a purely personal or household activity.
2
6. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to
3 this section shall not be processed for any purpose other than
4 those expressly listed in this section unless otherwise allowed
5 by this chapter. Personal data processed by a controller
6 pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that
7 such processing is as follows:
8
a. Reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes
9 listed in this section.
10
b. Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary
11 in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section.
12 Personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to
13 this section shall, where applicable, take into account
14 the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use,
15 or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable
16 administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the
17 confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal
18 data.
19
7. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an
20 exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of
21 demonstrating that such processing qualifies for the exemption
22 and complies with the requirements in subsection 6.
23
8. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly
24 identified in subsection 1 shall not in and of itself make an
25 entity a controller with respect to such processing.
26
9. This chapter shall not require a controller, processor,
27 third party, or consumer to disclose trade secrets.
28
Sec. 8. NEW SECTION. 715D.8 Enforcement —— penalties.
29
1. The attorney general shall have exclusive authority to
30 enforce the provisions of this chapter. Whenever the attorney
31 general has reasonable cause to believe that any person has
32 engaged in, is engaging in, or is about to engage in any
33 violation of this chapter, the attorney general is empowered to
34 issue a civil investigative demand. The provisions of section
35 685.6 shall apply to civil investigative demands issued under
1 this chapter.
2
2. Prior to initiating any action under this chapter,
3 the attorney general shall provide a controller or processor
4 ninety days’ written notice identifying the specific provisions
5 of this chapter the attorney general alleges have been or
6 are being violated. If within the ninety-day period, the
7 controller or processor cures the noticed violation and
8 provides the attorney general an express written statement that
9 the alleged violations have been cured and that no further such
10 violations shall occur, no action shall be initiated against
11 the controller or processor.
12
3. If a controller or processor continues to violate this
13 chapter following the cure period in subsection 2 or breaches
14 an express written statement provided to the attorney general
15 under that subsection, the attorney general may initiate an
16 action in the name of the state and may seek an injunction to
17 restrain any violations of this chapter and civil penalties of
18 up to seven thousand five hundred dollars for each violation
19 under this chapter. Any moneys collected under this section
20 including civil penalties, costs, attorney fees, or amounts
21 which are specifically directed shall be paid into the consumer
22 education and litigation fund established under section
23 714.16C.
24
4. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as providing
25 the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of action for
26 violations of this chapter or under any other law.
Sec. 9. NEW SECTION. 715D.9 Preemption.
