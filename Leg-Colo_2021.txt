PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS REQUIRED BY SECTION 6-1-1309. THE
CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR ARE EACH RESPONSIBLE FOR ONLY THE
MEASURES ALLOCATED TO THEM.

     (3) NOTWITHSTANDING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CONTROLLER, A
PROCESSOR SHALL:

      (a) ENSURE THAT EACH PERSON PROCESSING THE PERSONAL DATA IS
SUBJECT TO A DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA; AND

      (b)   ENGAGE   A SUBCONTRACTOR ONLY AFTER PROVIDING THE



CONTROLLER WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBJECT AND PURSUANT TO A
WRITTEN CONTRACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSECTION (5) OF THIS SECTION
THAT REQUIRES THE SUBCONTRACTOR TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PROCESSOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONAL DATA.

      (4) TAKING   INTO ACCOUNT THE CONTEXT OF PROCESSING, THE
CONTROLLER AND THE PROCESSOR SHALL IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE
TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE A LEVEL OF
SECURITY APPROPRIATE TO THE RISK AND ESTABLISH A CLEAR ALLOCATION
OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THEM TO IMPLEMENT THE MEASURES.

      (5)   PROCESSING BY A PROCESSOR MUST BE GOVERNED BY A
CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CONTROLLER AND THE PROCESSOR THAT IS
BINDING ON BOTH PARTIES AND THAT SETS OUT:

     (a) THE PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS TO WHICH THE PROCESSOR IS
BOUND, INCLUDING THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING;

      (b) THE TYPE OF PERSONAL DATA SUBJECT TO THE PROCESSING, AND
THE DURATION OF THE PROCESSING;

      (c) THE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY THIS     SUBSECTION   (5)   AND
SUBSECTIONS (3) AND (4) OF THIS SECTION; AND

      (d) THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:

      (I) AT THE CHOICE OF THE CONTROLLER, THE PROCESSOR SHALL
DELETE OR RETURN ALL PERSONAL DATA TO THE CONTROLLER AS
REQUESTED AT THE END OF THE PROVISION OF SERVICES, UNLESS RETENTION
OF THE PERSONAL DATA IS REQUIRED BY LAW;

      (II) (A) THE PROCESSOR SHALL MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE
CONTROLLER ALL INFORMATION NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE
WITH THE OBLIGATIONS IN THIS PART 13; AND

      (B) THE  PROCESSOR SHALL ALLOW FOR, AND CONTRIBUTE TO,
REASONABLE AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS BY THE CONTROLLER OR THE
CONTROLLER'S DESIGNATED AUDITOR. ALTERNATIVELY, THE PROCESSOR
MAY, WITH THE CONTROLLER'S CONSENT, ARRANGE FOR A QUALIFIED AND
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO CONDUCT, AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND AT THE

PROCESSOR FROM THE LIABILITIES IMPOSED ON THEM BY VIRTUE OF ITS ROLE
IN THE PROCESSING RELATIONSHIP AS DEFINED BY THIS PART 13.

      (7) DETERMINING WHETHER A PERSON IS ACTING AS A CONTROLLER
OR PROCESSOR WITH RESPECT TO A SPECIFIC PROCESSING OF DATA IS A
FACT-BASED DETERMINATION THAT DEPENDS UPON THE CONTEXT IN WHICH
PERSONAL DATA ARE TO BE PROCESSED. A PERSON THAT IS NOT LIMITED IN
ITS PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA PURSUANT TO A CONTROLLER'S
INSTRUCTIONS, OR THAT FAILS TO ADHERE TO THE INSTRUCTIONS, IS A
CONTROLLER AND NOT A PROCESSOR WITH RESPECT TO A SPECIFIC
PROCESSING OF DATA. A PROCESSOR THAT CONTINUES TO ADHERE TO A
CONTROLLER'S INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO A SPECIFIC PROCESSING OF
PERSONAL DATA REMAINS A PROCESSOR. IF A PROCESSOR BEGINS, ALONE OR
JOINTLY WITH OTHERS, DETERMINING THE PURPOSES AND MEANS OF THE
PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA, IT IS A CONTROLLER WITH RESPECT TO THE
PROCESSING.

      (8) (a) A CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR THAT DISCLOSES PERSONAL
DATA TO ANOTHER CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS
PART 13 DOES NOT VIOLATE THIS PART 13 IF THE RECIPIENT PROCESSES THE

DISCLOSING THE PERSONAL DATA, THE DISCLOSING CONTROLLER OR
PROCESSOR DID NOT HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE THAT THE RECIPIENT
INTENDED TO COMMIT A VIOLATION.

       (b) A CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR RECEIVING PERSONAL DATA FROM
A CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PART 13 AS
SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION (8)(a) OF THIS SECTION DOES NOT VIOLATE THIS
PART 13 IF THE CONTROLLER OR PROCESSOR FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES THE
PERSONAL DATA FAILS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE OBLIGATIONS UNDER
THIS PART 13.
