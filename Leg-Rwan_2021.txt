CHAPTER II: PROCESSING AND QUALITY OF PERSONAL DATA Section One: Processing of personal data Article 4: Authorisation to process personal data The processing of personal data carried out by the data processor is governed by a written contract between the data processor and the data controller. The data processor processes personal data on behalf of the data controller subject to a written contract referred to in Paragraph One of this Article. The data controller authorises the data processor who provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing meets the requirements of this Law. Article 5: Privacy of the data subject The data controller, the data processor or a third
party processes personal data in a manner which does not infringe on the privacy of the data subject. Article 6: Consent of the data subject Where the processing of personal data is based on the consent of the data subject, data subject demonstrates that he or she has consented to the processing of his or her personal data for a specified purpose. The consent of the data subject is valid only when it is based on the data subject's free decision after being informed of the consequences of his or her consent. The consent of the data subject may be made in oral, written or electronic form. Article 7: Indication of other matters in the declaration of consent The data subject's declaration of consent that contains other matters must clearly indicate those other matters to which he or she consents in one of the official languages that is understandable to him or her.
Any part of the declaration referred to in Paragraph One of this Article which constitutes an infringement of the provisions of this Law cannot be binding. Article 8: Right of the data subject to withdraw his or her consent The data subject has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent by the data subject does not affect the lawfulness of processing of personal data based on consent before its withdrawal. The withdrawal of consent by the data subject is as easy as expressing it. The withdrawal of consent by the data subject takes effect as of the date on which the data subject applied for it. Article 9: Processing a child's personal data Where the data controller, the data processor or a third party knows that personal data
belong to a child under the age of sixteen (16) years, he or she must obtain the consent of a holder of parental responsibility over the child in accordance with relevant Laws. Subject to the provisions of other Laws, the consent obtained on behalf of the child is acceptable only if it is given in the interest of the child. However, the consent is not required to process the child's personal data if it is necessary for protecting the vital interest of the child. Article 10: Grounds for processing sensitive personal data The data controller or the data processor processes sensitive personal data only if: 1° the processing is based on the data subject's consent; 2° the processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations of the data controller, of the data processor or exercising specific rights of the data subject in accordance with relevant Laws;
3° the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of any other person; 4° the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, public health such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices; 5° the processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest or scientific and historical research purposes or statistical purposes. Article 11: Safeguards to process sensitive personal data When processing sensitive personal data, the data controller or the data processor must: 1° comply with requirements for personal data protection or personal data monitoring as required by this Law;
2° comply with applicable sensitive personal data retention periods established by this Law; 3° put in place measures to strengthen capacities of staff involved in the processing of sensitive personal data; 4° put in place measures to access sensitive personal data processed by the data controller or the data processor; 5° implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the data subject, including, where appropriate, storing sensitive personal data separately from other types of data, and applying measures such as tokenisation, pseudonymisation or encryption. Article 12: Processing personal data of a convict Processing personal data of a convict is carried
out under the supervision of the supervisory authority in accordance with the provisions of this Law. The data controller or the data processor puts in place appropriate safeguards to ensure the respect of rights and freedoms of the data subject. Article 13: Processing of personal data which does not require data subject's identification If the purposes for which the data controller or the data processor processes personal data do not or no longer require the identification of the data subject, the data controller or the data processor is not obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Law. In case the data controller or the data processor is unable to identify the data subject because of the alteration of his or her personal data, the data controller informs the data subject in writing or electronically, if necessary. However, the data subject, with respect to his or her rights, provides additional information
enabling his or her identification. Article 14: Source of personal data The data controller or the data processor requests personal data directly from the data subject. However, a person can collect personal data from another person, another source or a public institution if: 1° the personal data is open to the public; 2° the data subject has deliberately made the personal data public; 3° the data subject has consented to the collection of personal data from another source; 4° the collection of the personal data from another source complies with the provisions of this Law.
Section 2: Quality of personal data and records of personal data Article 15: Quality of personal data The data controller or the data processor ensures that the personal data is complete, accurate, kept up to date and not misleading having regard to the purposes for which they are processed. Article 16: Personal data logging The data controller or the data processor ensures personal data logging at least on the following data operations: 1° data collected; 2° data altered; 3° data accessed; 4° data disclosed including data sharing and transfer; 5° combined data; 6° erased data. Personal data logging must indicate justification, date and time of such operations and, where possible, the contact details of the person who accessed or disclosed the personal
data, as well as the contact details of the recipients of the data. The supervisory authority may require the data controller or the data processor to provide access to the personal data logging so as to verify the lawfulness of the personal data processing. Article 17: Maintaining records of processed personal data The data controller or the data processor must maintain a record of all personal data processing activities under his or her responsibility that indicates: 1° the name and contact details of the data controller and, where applicable, the data processor, the controller's representative or the data protection officer; 2° the purposes of the processing of personal data; 3° a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;
4° a full list of the recipients to whom personal data have been or will be disclosed, including those based in other countries; 5° a description of transfers of personal data to any country outside Rwanda; 6° where possible, the envisaged data retention periods for the different categories of personal data. The data controller or the data processor submits the records of personal data processing activities to the supervisory authority on request. CHAPTER III: RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT Article 18: Right to personal data Without prejudice to other relevant Laws, the data subject may, in writing or electronically, request from the data controller or the data processor the following:
1° to provide him or her with the information relating to the purposes of the processing of personal data; 2° to provide him or her with a copy of personal data; 3° to provide him or her with a description of personal data that the data controller or the data processor holds, including data on the contact details of a third party or the categories of third parties who have or had access to personal data; 4° to inform him or her of the source of the personal data in case his or her personal data have not been obtained from the data subject; 5° to inform him or her in case his or her personal data have been transferred to a third country or to an international organisation.

legal obligation of confidentiality applies; 3° the data relates to information management or information about the data subject or relates to ongoing negotiations with the data subject requester; 4° the data relates to the data subject's confidential references, examination scripts or examination marks. The data controller or the data processor must provide the data subject with his or her personal data in a clear and concise manner. The data subject who is not satisfied with the response of the data controller or the data processor may appeal to the supervisory authority within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the response. If the data subject appeals, the supervisory authority responds to his or her appeal within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the appeal.
Article 19: Right to object The data subject, at any time in writing or electronically, may request the data controller or the data processor to stop processing his or her personal data which causes or is likely to cause loss, sadness or anxiety to the data subject. However, this right does not apply if the data controller or the data processor demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the personnel data processing, which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment of the legal claim. The data subject, at any time in writing or electronically, may request the data controller or the data processor to stop processing personal data of the data subject if personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. The data controller or the data processor, within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the request, must inform the concerned data subject in writing or electronically of the
compliance with the request or reasons for non-compliance. The data subject who is not satisfied with the response of the data controller or the data processor may appeal to the supervisory authority within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the response. If the data subject appeals, the supervisory authority responds to his or her appeal within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the appeal. Article 20: Right to personal data portability The data subject has the right to request the data controller in writing or electronically to resend the personal data concerning him or her as it was provided to the data controller, in a structured and readable format. The data subject also has the right to request the data controller in writing or electronically to have his or her personal data transmitted to another data controller, where technically feasible, without hindrance.
The data controller, within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the request, must inform the concerned data subject in writing or electronically of personal data portability. The data subject who is not satisfied with the response of the data controller may appeal to the supervisory authority within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the response. If the data subject appeals, the supervisory authority responds to his or her appeal within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the appeal. Article 21: Right not to be subject to a decision based on automated data processing The data subject has the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated personal data processing, including profiling, which may produce legal consequences or significant consequences to him or her. However, the provisions of Paragraph One of this Article do not apply if the decision:
1° is based on the data subject's explicit consent; 2° is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and the data controller; 3° is authorised by Laws to which the data controller is subject and also puts in place suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights, freedoms and legitimate interests. Any automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person does not base on sensitive personal data unless one of the grounds set out in Article 10 of this Law is met. Article 22: Right to restriction of processing of personal data The data subject or the supervisory authority has the right to restrict the data controller from processing personal data for a given period if: 1° the accuracy of personal data is
contested by the data subject, pending the verification of their accuracy; 2° the processing is unlawful and the data subject requests the erasure of the personal data or the restriction of the use of some of them; 3° the data subject has objected to the processing of personal data pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject. The right to restriction of processing of personal data described in Paragraph One of this Article is not exercised if the processing of personal data: 1° is necessary for the protection of the rights of another person; 2° is necessary for reasons of public interest. The data controller must, before lifting the restriction of processing of personal data referred to in item 1o of Paragraph 2 of this
Article, inform the data subject in writing or electronically. Article 23: Right to erasure of personal data The data subject has the right to request the data controller in writing or electronically for erasure of his or her personal data where: 1° the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or processed; 2° the data subject withdraws consent on which the personal data processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for the processing; 3° the data subject objects to the processing of personal data and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing; 4° the personal data have been unlawfully processed. The data controller who has disclosed personal
data to a third party or has posted the personal data in the public domain must, in writing or electronically, inform a third party processing such data that the data subject has requested the erasure of any links to, or copy of, those personal data. However, the right to request the erasure of personal data does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary: 1° for reasons of public interest; 2° for historical or scientific research purposes or statistical purposes; 3° for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller; 4° for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the interest of the data controller.

Article 44: Report on personal data breach The data controller draws up a report on personal data breach and submits it to the supervisory authority not later than seventytwo (72) hours, with all facts available. The report describes at least: 1° the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned; 2° the contact details of the personal data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained; 3° the measures taken to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible
adverse effects; 4° the acts relating to personal data breaches, the consequences of the personal data breach and the measures taken to rectify such a breach; 5° his or her proposal for communicating the personal data breach to affected data subjects and the timeline for such a communication, for approval by the supervisory authority. Article 45: Communication of a personal data breach to the data subject Where the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject, the data controller communicates the personal data breach to the data subject in writing or electronically, after having become aware of it. However, the data controller is not required to communicate the personal data breach to the data subject if: 1° the data controller has implemented
appropriate technical and organisational protection measures in relation to personal data breached such that the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject; 2° the data controller has taken measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject is no longer likely to materialize; 3° the data controller communicated it to the public whereby the data subject is informed in an equally effective manner. If the data controller has not communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, and the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject, the supervisory authority may request the data controller to communicate the personal data breach to the data subject in writing or electronically.
Article 46: Lawful processing of personal data The data controller or the data processor lawfully processes personal data if: 1° the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for purposes explained to him or her; 2° processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; 3° the data controller executes a legal obligation to which he or she is a subject; 4° it is necessary for protection of vital interests of the data subject or any other person; 5° it is necessary for the performance of a duty carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller; 6° it is carried out for the performance of
duties of a public entity; 7° it is intended for legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by a third party to whom the personal data are disclosed, unless the processing of personal data is unwarranted in any particular case having regard to the prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests pursued by the data subject; 8° it is carried out for research purposes upon authorisation by relevant institution. Article 47: Measures to ensure security of personal data The data controller or the data processor must ensure security of the personal data in his or her possession by, adopting appropriate, reasonable technical measures to prevent loss, damage or destruction of personal data. For purposes of enforcing the provisions of Paragraph One of this Article, the data controller or the data processor takes the following measures to ensure security of personal data:
1° identify foreseeable risks to personal data under that person's possession or control, establish and maintain appropriate safeguards against those risks; 2° regularly verify whether the personal data security safeguards are effectively implemented; 3° ensure that the personal data security safeguards are continually updated in response to new risks or any identified deficiencies. When the supervisory authority is of the opinion that processing or transferring personal data may infringe the rights and privacy of the data subject, the supervisory authority conducts an inspection and assessment of the measures set out in this Article. CHAPTER VI: SHARING, TRANSFER, STORAGE AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA Article 48: Sharing and transfer of personal data outside Rwanda The data controller or the data processor may
share or transfer personal data to a third party outside Rwanda if: 1° he or she has obtained authorisation from the supervisory authority after providing proof of appropriate safeguards with respect to the protection of personal data; 2° the data subject has given his or her consent; 3° the transfer is necessary: a. for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the data controller or the implementation of precontractual measures taken in response to the data subject's request; b. for the performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the data controller and a third party; c. for public interest grounds; d. for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim; e. to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another person where the data subject is physically or legally
incapable of giving his or her consent; f. for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the data processor, which are not overridden by the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, and when: i. the transfer is not repetitive and concerns only a limited number of data subjects; ii. the data controller or the data processor has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has, on the basis of that assessment, provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data; g. for the performance of international instruments ratified by Rwanda. The supervisory authority may put in place a regulation determining another reason of sharing or transferring personal data to a third party outside Rwanda.
Article 49: Contract for transfer of personal data The data controller or the data processor who authorises a person to access personal data, share or transfer them to a third party outside Rwanda, enters into a written contract with such a person setting out the respective roles and responsibilities of each party to ensure compliance with this Law. The supervisory authority may, by a regulation, determine the form of the contract to be used for transfers of personal data outside Rwanda. Provisions of Items 1 o and 3° a), b) and d) of Article 48 of this Law do not apply to activities carried out by a public body in the exercise of its functions. The supervisory authority may require the data controller or the data processor to demonstrate their compliance with the provisions of this Article, and in particular, with personal data security safeguards and interests referred to in Item 3° f) of Article 48 of this Law.
The supervisory authority, in order to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subject, may prohibit or suspend the transfer of personal data outside Rwanda. Article 50: Storage of personal data The data controller or the data processor stores personal data in Rwanda. However, the storage of personal data outside Rwanda is only permitted if the data controller or the data processor holds a valid registration certificate authorising him or her to store personal data outside Rwanda, which is issued by the supervisory authority. Article 51: Migration and management of personal data after change or closure of business The supervisory authority puts in place a regulation determining modalities for migration and management of personal data in case of change or closure of business of the data controller or the data processor.
Article 52: Retention of personal data The data controller or the data processor retains personal data until the purposes of the processing of personal data are fulfilled. However, the data controller or the data processor may retain personal data for a longer period for the following grounds: 1° if retention is authorised by Law; 2° if retention is required by a contract concluded between the parties; 3° if the personal data is related to a function or activity for which the personal data are collected or processed; 4° preventing, detecting, investigating, prosecuting or punishing an offender; 5° protecting national security; 6° enforcing a court order;
7° enforcing legislation relating to collection of public revenues; 8° conducting proceedings before a court; 9° carrying out research authorised by a relevant authority; 10°if the data subject consents. The supervisory authority may put in place a regulation determining any other ground for retention of personal data for a longer period. At the end of the personal data retention period, the data controller or the data processor must destroy the personal data in a manner that prevents its reconstruction in an intelligible form.
CHAPTER VIII: MISCONDUCTS, OFFENCES AND SANCTIONS Section One: Administrative misconducts and sanctions Article 53: Administrative misconducts The data controller, the data processor or a third party who commits one of the following misconducts: 1° failure to maintain records of processed personal data; 2° failure to carry out personal data logging; 3° operating without a registration certificate; 4° failure to report a change after receiving a registration certificate; 5° using a certificate whose term of validity has expired; 6° failure to designate a personal data protection officer;
