European Treaty Series - No. 108

Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic
Processing of Personal Data
Strasbourg, 28.I.1981

Preamble
The member States of the Council of Europe, signatory hereto,
Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve greater unity between its
members, based in particular on respect for the rule of law, as well as human rights and
fundamental freedoms;
Considering that it is desirable to extend the safeguards for everyone's rights and
fundamental freedoms, and in particular the right to the respect for privacy, taking account of
the increasing flow across frontiers of personal data undergoing automatic processing;
Reaffirming at the same time their commitment to freedom of information regardless of
frontiers;
Recognising that it is necessary to reconcile the fundamental values of the respect for privacy
and the free flow of information between peoples,
Have agreed as follows:
Chapter I – General provisions
Article 1 – Object and purpose
The purpose of this Convention is to secure in the territory of each Party for every individual,
whatever his nationality or residence, respect for his rights and fundamental freedoms, and in
particular his right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing of personal data relating to
him ("data protection").
Article 2 – Definitions
For the purposes of this Convention:
a

"personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual
("data subject");

b

"automated data file" means any set of data undergoing automatic processing;

c

"automatic processing" includes the following operations if carried out in whole or in part
by automated means: storage of data, carrying out of logical and/or arithmetical
operations on those data, their alteration, erasure, retrieval or dissemination;
__________________________________________________________________________________
d

"controller of the file" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any
other body who is competent according to the national law to decide what should be the
purpose of the automated data file, which categories of personal data should be stored
and which operations should be applied to them.

Article 3 – Scope
1

The Parties undertake to apply this Convention to automated personal data files and
automatic processing of personal data in the public and private sectors.

2

Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument of ratification,
acceptance, approval or accession, or at any later time, give notice by a declaration
addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe:
a

that it will not apply this Convention to certain categories of automated personal data
files, a list of which will be deposited. In this list it shall not include, however, categories
of automated data files subject under its domestic law to data protection provisions.
Consequently, it shall amend this list by a new declaration whenever additional
categories of automated personal data files are subjected to data protection provisions
under its domestic law;

b

that it will also apply this Convention to information relating to groups of persons,
associations, foundations, companies, corporations and any other bodies consisting
directly or indirectly of individuals, whether or not such bodies possess legal personality;

c

that it will also apply this Convention to personal data files which are not processed
automatically.

3

Any State which has extended the scope of this Convention by any of the declarations
provided for in sub-paragraph 2.b or c above may give notice in the said declaration that such
extensions shall apply only to certain categories of personal data files, a list of which will be
deposited.

4

Any Party which has excluded certain categories of automated personal data files by a
declaration provided for in sub-paragraph 2.a above may not claim the application of this
Convention to such categories by a Party which has not excluded them.

5

Likewise, a Party which has not made one or other of the extensions provided for in subparagraphs 2.b and c above may not claim the application of this Convention on these points
with respect to a Party which has made such extensions.

6

The declarations provided for in paragraph 2 above shall take effect from the moment of the
entry into force of the Convention with regard to the State which has made them if they have
been made at the time of signature or deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance,
approval or accession, or three months after their receipt by the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe if they have been made at any later time. These declarations may be
withdrawn, in whole or in part, by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe. Such withdrawals shall take effect three months after the date of receipt of
such notification.

as the identity and habitual residence or principal place of business of the controller of
the file;

b

to obtain at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense confirmation of
whether personal data relating to him are stored in the automated data file as well as
communication to him of such data in an intelligible form;

c

to obtain, as the case may be, rectification or erasure of such data if these have been
processed contrary to the provisions of domestic law giving effect to the basic principles
set out in Articles 5 and 6 of this Convention;

2

Derogation from the provisions of Articles 5, 6 and 8 of this Convention shall be allowed when

when the transfer is made from its territory to the territory of a non-Contracting State
through the intermediary of the territory of another Party, in order to avoid such transfers
