Section 10
Preparation of a statement of file

The controller of the file shall on request provide infor­
mation on the intended purpose and type of data also in re­
spect of a personal data file for which no statement of file
need be prepared.
If the display of a statement of file for public inspec­
tion may endanger the security of the State or relations with
another state or international organization or impair the
prevention or investigation of an offence, it may be ordered
by Decree that the information referred to in paragraph 1
shall be given only to the Data Protection Ombudsman.

Section 11
The data subject's right of inspection
Every person has the right, notwithstanding the provisions
on secrecy, and after he has provided information on facts
necessary to seek the data, to be informed on what data are
recorded in a personal data file regarding him or that there
are no data regarding him on the personal data file.

At the same time, the controller of the file shall notify the data
subject of the normal data sources of the file and of the
purpose for which the data in the file are used and normally
delivered. The controller of the file may collect remunera­
tion for providing data only if less than one year has passed
since the previous time the person in question received the
data in the file for inspection.

The remuneration to be col­

lected shall be reasonable and may not exceed the immediate
expenses resulting from the provision of the data.
A person who wants to inspect data regarding himself in
the manner referred to in paragraph 1 shall present a request
to this effect in person to the controller of the file at his
place of business or in the form of a letter signed in person
by the person presenting the request. More detailed provi­
sions shall be issued by Decree on the implementation of the
right of inspection of personal data files in health care.
Section 12
Limitations on the right of inspection
The right of inspection referred to above in paragraph 11
shall not apply in the following cases:
1) if the provision of the data might endanger the securi­
ty of the State or relations with another state or an inter­
national organization, impair the prevention or investigation
of an offence

or violate another very important public inter

est;
2) if the provision of the data might seriously endanger
the health or treatment of the data subject or if the provi­
sion of the data might violate another very important private
interest;
3) if the personal data in the file are used solely for
statistical purposes in research or planning activity; or
4) if, where the personal assessments which serve as the
basis for salaries are contained in a personal data file
which is maintained by an employer on his employees in a non­
computerized form, the appropriate collective agreement on
the salaries of the employees or civil servants provides for
the basis of such salaries or, if this is not the case, this
has been agreed upon with the employee; this shall also apply
to a personal data file kept by an employer in a correspond­
ing manner for the selection of employees if said list is
erased as soon as it is no longer necessary for the manage­
ment of the statutory obligations of the employer.
If only part of the data applying to the data subject is
such that they lie outside of the scope of the right of in­
spection under subparagraphs 1 and 2 of paragraph 1, the data
subject shall have the right to inspect the other data record
ed on him.
If a person has the right to be informed of data on him
contained in a personal data file through a procedure provid­
ed by Act or Decree or by action of the controller of the
file, it may be provided by Decree that such personal data
files shall remain outside the scope of the right of inspec­
tion.
Section 13
The right of inspection of personal credit data files
A controller of a file engaged in credit data activity
shall notify the data subject of the first entry regarding
said person in the personal credit data file.
On the request of the data subject, a controller of a file
engaged in credit data activity shall provide information on
to whom or to where personal credit data regarding this per­
son has been delivered over the previous six months and from
whom or from where the data on the data subject are derived.
The provisions of section 11 shall otherwise apply to the
right of inspection.
Section 14
Fulfillment of the right of inspection
The controller of the file shall, without undue delay, re­
serve the data subject the opportunity to acquaint himself
with the data referred to in section 11 or, on request, pro­
vide the data in writing.
If the controller of the file re­
fuses to provide the data, he shall provide a written certi­
ficate thereof on request. The certificate shall also state
the reasons for which the right of inspection has been de­
nied .
If the controller of the file has not provided the data
subject a written reply within three months of the presenta­
tion of the request, this shall be deemed the equivalent of
refusal of the right of inspection.
Section 15
Rectification of an error
The controller of the file shall ensure that personal data
that are erroneous, unnecessary, defective or outdated from
the point of view of the intended use of the personal data
file shall be rectified, deleted or supplemented without un­
due delay (rectification of an error) if it is apparent that
such data endanger the protection of the privacy, interests
or rights of the data subject.

An error shall always be rec­

tified on the justified demand of the data subject.
If the controller of the file rejects the demand for the
rectification of an error, he shall give a written certifi­
cate of this on request.

The certificate shall also note the

reasons for which the demand was rejected.
If the error may violate the interests or rights of the
data subject, the controller of the file shall inform the
party to which he has delivered or from which he has received
the erroneous personal data in the normal delivery of data of
the rectification of the error.

On the justified demand of

the data subject, a notice shall always be made of the recti­
fication of an error to a party to whom the controller of the
file knows that he has probably delivered the erroneous per­
sonal data or to a party from whom the controller of the file
knows that he has probably received the erroneous personal
data, and to the party delivering or receiving data, indicat­
ed by the data subject.

2) in accordance with an Act or Decree or an order issued
under an Act or Decree;
3) under circumstances where the delivery of the personal
data is a normal part of such activity; however, in this a
precondition for delivery shall be that it may be assumed
that the data subject is aware of such delivery of the person
al data and that it is not a question of sensitive data; or
4) for scientific research or statistics.
Other than sensitive personal data may be delivered from a
personal data file for direct advertising, sales by telephone
and other direct marketing as well as for directory assist­
ance, unless the data subject has prohibited the delivery of
the data, and if it is apparent that the data subject knows
about such delivery of personal data.

More detailed provisions on the data to be delivered shall be provided by Dec­
ree.
Personal credit data may be delivered only to a controller
of a file engaged in credit data activity and to a party re­
quiring the data for the granting of credit, for the supervi­
sion of credit or for another comparable purpose.
The providing of personal data for budget accounting, data
processing, posting or other comparable tasks on assignment
for the controller of the file shall not be deemed delivery
of personal data, nor shall the transfer of personal data to
a joint data file referred to in section 5, paragraph 3 or

takes place on assignment for the data subject;
2) if such delivery of data takes place under section 18,
paragraph 3 or under another Act or Decree or on the basis of
permission granted by the Data Protection Board; or
3) if the party receiving the data has, under this Act,
the right to record personal data in a personal data file and
the delivery and use of the personal data does not endanger
the protection of the privacy, interests and rights of the
data subject or the security of the State.
In the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the personal
identity code may be delivered only if the party receiving
the data already has this at his disposal, he has the right
to receive it from the data subject or from the population
register, or the delivery takes place for a scientific study,

Section 20
The combining of personal data files
Personal data files may be combined only if:

1) the data subject has consented thereto or the Data Pro­

danger the protection of the privacy, interests and rights of
the data subject.
The formation of one file from two or more technically se­
parate personal data files kept by the same party shall not

file.
Section 22

Personal data in or collected for a personal data file
may, without permission from the Data Protection Board or the
consent or assignment of the data subject, be delivered as
mass delivery or as a sensitive sample only to a country that
has legislation that corresponds to the provisions of the
present Act. More detailed provisions on such countries
shall be issued by Decree.
Permission may be granted only if it is apparent that, tak
ing into consideration the amount, type and intended purpose
of the personal data to be delivered as well as the protective measures to be undertaken, the delivery does not endan­
ger the protection of the privacy of the data subject or vio­
late his interests or rights or endanger the security of the
State.
Personal data may be delivered to another State for data
processing and posting on assignment for the controller of
the file if the delivery and use of the personal data does

in certain cases
A party who has obtained personal credit data on a data
subject for use in decision making regarding this person
shall notify him of the use of the credit data in decision
making and of the source of the credit data in the file if
the refusal of credit or other negative decision in respect
of the data subject is primarily due to the credit data re­
ceived .
In direct advertising, sales by telephone and other direct
marketing as well as in questionnaires for market and opinion
research for which the name and address of a person have been
obtained from a personal data file, notice shall be given of
the name of the personal data file used in the acquiring of
