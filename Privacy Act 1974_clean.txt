              6. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
                       PRIVACY ACT 1974

  Sec. 2.    (a) The Congress finds that—
         (1) the privacy of an individual is directly affected by the
     collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal
     information by Federal agencies;
         (2) the increasing use of computers and sophisticated infor­
     mation technology, while essential to the efficient operations of
     the Government, has greatly magnified the harm to individual
     privacy that can occur from any collection, maintenance, use,
     or dissemination of personal information;
         (3) the opportunities for an individual to secure employ­
     ment, insurance, and credit, and his right to due process, and
     other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain
     information systems;
         (4) the right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right
     protected by the Constitution of the United States; and
         (5) in order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in
     information systems maintained by Federal agencies, it is neces­
     sary and proper for the Congress to regulate the collection, main­
     tenance, use, and dissemination of information by such agencies.
  (b) The purpose of this Act is to provide certain safeguards for an
individual against an invasion of personal privacy by requiring
Federal agencies, except as otherwise provided by law, to—
         (1) permit an individual to determine what records pertain­
     ing to him are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by
     such agencies;
         (2) permit an individual to prevent records pertaining to him
     obtained by such agencies for a particular purpose from being
     used or made available for another purpose without his consent;
         (3) permit an individual to gain access to information per­
     taining to him in Federal agency records, to have a copy made
     of all or any portion thereof, and to correct or amend such
     records;
         (4) collect, maintain, use, or disseminate any record of iden­
     tifiable personal information in a manner that assures that such
     action is for a necessary and lawful purpose, that the information

                                  206
                           Appendix B

     is current and accurate for its intended use, and that adequate
     safeguards are provided to prevent misuse of such informa­
     tion;
         (5) permit exemptions from the requirements with respect to
     records provided in this Act only in those cases where there is an
     important public policy need for such exemption as has been
     determined by specific statutory authority; and
        (6) be subject to civil suit for any damages which occur as a
     result of willful or intentional action which violates any indivi­
     dual’s rights under this Act.
   Sec. 3. Title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding after

mulgate rules, in accordance with the requirements (including
general notice) of sections 553(b) (1), (2), and (3), (c), and (e) of
this title, to exempt any system of records within the agency from
subsections (c) (3), (d), (e) (1), (e) (4) (G), (H), and (I) and (f) of

     denied any right, privilege, or benefit that he would otherwise
     be entitled by Federal law, or for which he would otherwise be
     eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such
     material shall be provided to such individual, except to the
     extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the
     identity of a source who furnished information to the Govern­
     ment under an express promise that the identity of the source
     would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of

                                   215

     determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal
     civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or
     access to classified information, but only to the extent that the
     disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source
     who furnished information to the Government under an express
     promise that the identity of the source would be held in confi­
     dence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an
     implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in
     confidence;
         “ (6) testing or examination material used solely to determine

     Federal service the disclosure of which would compromise the
     objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process; or
         “(7) evaluation material used to determine potential for pro­
     motion in the armed services, but only to the extent that the
     disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source
     who furnished information to the Government under an express
     promise that the identity of the source would be held in confi­
     dence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an

a contract for the operation by or on behalf of the agency of a system
of records to accomplish an agency function, the agency shall, con­
sistent with its authority, cause the requirements of this section to be
applied to such system. For purposes of subsection (i) of this section

contract is agreed to on or after the effective date of this section, shall
be considered to be an employee of an agency.
   “(n) Mailing Lists.—An individual’s name and address may not
be sold or rented by an agency unless such action is specifically

                              Appendix B

made public.
   “(o) Report on New Systems.—Each agency shall provide ade­
quate advance notice to Congress and the Office of Management
and Budget of any proposal to establish or alter any system of records
in order to permit an evaluation of the probable or potential effect
of such proposal on the privacy and other personal or property
rights of individuals or the disclosure of information relating to such
individuals, and its effect on the preservation of the constitutional
principles of federalism and separation of powers.
   “ (p) Annual Report.—The President shall submit to the Speaker
of the House and the President of the Senate, by June 30 of each
calendar year, a consolidated report, separately listing for each Fed­
eral agency the number of records contained in any system of records
which were exempted from the application of this section under the

ceding calendar year, and the reasons for the exemptions, and such
other information as indicates efforts to administer fully this section.
   (q) Effect of Other Laws.—No agency shall rely on any exemp­
tion contained in section 552 of this title to withhold from an indivi­
dual any record which is otherwise accessible to such individual
under the provisions of this section.”.

         (A) determine what laws, Executive orders, regulations,
