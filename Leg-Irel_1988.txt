(3) Paragraph (a) of the said subsection (1) does not apply to information intended for
inclusion in data, or to data, kept for a purpose mentioned in section 5 (1) (a) of this Act, in any

historical, statistical or research purposes, and
(b) the data or, as the case may be, the information constituting such data shall not be

data subject.
(6) (a) The Minister may, for the purpose of providing additional safeguards in relation to

for that purpose,
the data controller shall, as soon as may be and in any event not more than 40 days after the
request has been given or sent to him—
(i) if the data are kept only for the purpose aforesaid, erase the data,

that purpose, and
(iii) notify the data subject in writing accordingly and, where appropriate, inform
him of those other purposes.
Right to establish existence
of personal data.

3.—An individual who believes that a person keeps personal data shall, if he so requests the
person in writing—
(a) be informed by the person whether he keeps any such data, and
(b) if he does, be given by the person a description of the data and the purposes for which
they are kept,
as soon as may be and in any event not more than 21 days after the request has been given or
sent to him.

Right of access.

4.—(1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this Act, an individual shall, if he so requests a data
controller in writing—
(i) be informed by the data controller whether the data kept by him include
personal data relating to the individual, and
(ii) be supplied by the data controller with a copy of the information
constituting any such data,
as soon as may be and in any event not more than 40 days after compliance by
the individual with the provisions of this section; and, where any of the
information is expressed in terms that are not intelligible to the average person
without explanation, the information shall be accompanied by an explanation
of those terms.
(b) A request for the information specified in subparagraph (i) of subsection (1) (a)

as including a request for a copy of the information specified in subparagraph
(ii) of the said subsection (1) (a).
(c) (i) A fee may be payable to the data controller concerned in respect of such a
request as aforesaid and the amount thereof shall not exceed such amount
as may be prescribed or an amount that in the opinion of the
Commissioner is reasonable, having regard to the estimated cost to the
data controller of compliance with the request, whichever is the lesser.
(ii) A fee paid by an individual to a data controller under subparagraph (i) of
this paragraph shall be returned to him if his request is not complied with
or the data controller rectifies or supplements, or erases part of, the data
concerned (and thereby materially modifies the data) or erases all of the
data on the application of the individual or in accordance with an
enforcement notice or an order of a court.
(2) Where pursuant to provision made in that behalf under this Act there are separate entries
in the register in respect of data kept by a data controller for different purposes, subsection (1)
of this section shall apply as if it provided for the making of a separate request and the payment
of a separate fee in respect of the data to which each entry relates.

concerned with such information as he may reasonably require in order to satisfy himself of the
identity of the individual and to locate any relevant personal data or information.
(4) Nothing in subsection (1) of this section obliges a data controller to disclose to a data
subject personal data relating to another individual unless that other individual has consented to
the disclosure:
Provided that, where the circumstances are such that it would be reasonable for the data
controller to conclude that, if any particulars identifying that other individual were omitted, the
data could then be disclosed as aforesaid without his being thereby identified to the data subject,
the data controller shall be obliged to disclose the data to the data subject with the omission of
those particulars.
(5) Information supplied pursuant to a request under subsection (1) of this section may take
account of any amendment of the personal data concerned made since the receipt of the request
by the data controller (being an amendment that would have been made irrespective of the
receipt of the request) but not of any other amendment.
(6) (a) A request by an individual under subsection (1) of this section in relation to the results
of an examination at which he was a candidate shall be deemed, for the purposes
of this section, to be made on—
(i) the date of the first publication of the results of the examination, or
(ii) the date of the request,
whichever is the later; and paragraph (a) of the said subsection (1) shall be
construed and have effect in relation to such a request as if for “40 days” there
were substituted “60 days”.
(b) In this subsection “examination” means any process for determining the knowledge,
intelligence, skill or ability of a person by reference to his performance in any test,
work or other activity.
(7) A notification of a refusal of a request made by an individual under and in compliance
with the preceding provisions of this section shall be in writing and shall include a statement of
the reasons for the refusal and an indication that the individual may complain to the
Commissioner about the refusal.
(8) (a) If and whenever the Minister considers it desirable in the interests of data subjects to
do so and by regulations so declares, the application of this section to personal
data—
(i) relating to physical or mental health, or
(ii) kept for, or obtained in the course of, carrying out social work by a Minister of
the Government, a local authority, a health board or a specified voluntary
organisation or other body,
may be modified by the regulations in such manner, in such circumstances, subject
to such safeguards and to such extent as may be specified therein.
(b) Regulations under paragraph (a) of this subsection shall be made only after
consultation with the Minister for Health and any other Minister of the
Government who, having regard to his functions, ought, in the opinion of the
Minister, to be consulted and may make different provision in relation to data of
different descriptions.
Restriction of right of access.

5.—(1) Section 4 of this Act does not apply to personal data—
(a) kept for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating offences, apprehending
or prosecuting offenders or assessing or collecting any tax, duty or other moneys
owed or payable to the State, a local authority or a health board, in any case in
which the application of that section to the data would be likely to prejudice any of
the matters aforesaid,
(b) to which, by virtue of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the said section 4 does not
apply and which are kept for the purpose of discharging a function conferred by or
under any enactment and consisting of information obtained for such a purpose
from a person who had it in his possession for any of the purposes mentioned in
paragraph (a) of this subsection,
(c) in any case in which the application of that section would be likely to prejudice the
security of, or the maintenance of good order and discipline in—
(i) a prison,
(ii) a place of detention provided under section 2 of the Prison Act, 1970 ,
(iii) a military prison or detention barrack within the meaning of the Defence Act,
1954 , or
(iv) Saint Patrick's Institution,
(d) kept for the purpose of performing such functions conferred by or under any
enactment as may be specified by regulations made by the Minister, being
functions that, in the opinion of the Minister, are designed to protect members of
the public against financial loss occasioned by—
(i) dishonesty, incompetence or malpractice on the part of persons concerned in the
provision of banking, insurance, investment or other financial services or in
the management of companies or similar organisations, or
(ii) the conduct of persons who have at any time been adjudicated bankrupt,
in any case in which the application of that section to the data would be likely to
prejudice the proper performance of any of those functions,
(e) in respect of which the application of that section would be contrary to the interests of
protecting the international relations of the State,
(f) consisting of an estimate of, or kept for the purpose of estimating, the amount of the
liability of the data controller concerned on foot of a claim for the payment of a
sum of money, whether in respect of damages or compensation, in any case in
which the application of the section would be likely to prejudice the interests of
the data controller in relation to the claim,
(g) in respect of which a claim of privilege could be maintained in proceedings in a court
in relation to communications between a client and his professional legal advisers
or between those advisers,
(h) kept only for the purpose of preparing statistics or carrying out research if the data are
not used or disclosed (other than to a person to whom a disclosure of such data
may be made in the circumstances specified in section 8 of this Act) for any other
purpose and the resulting statistics or the results of the research are not made
available in a form that identifies any of the data subjects, or
(i) that are back-up data.
(2) Regulations under subsections (1) (d) and (3) (b) of this section shall be made only after
consultation with any other Minister of the Government who, having regard to his functions,
ought, in the opinion of the Minister, to be consulted.
(3) (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this subsection, section 4 of this Act, as modified by any
other provisions thereof, shall apply notwithstanding any provision of or made
under any enactment or rule of law that is in force immediately before the passing
of this Act and prohibits or restricts the disclosure, or authorises the withholding,
of information.
(b) If and whenever the Minister is of opinion that a prohibition, restriction or
authorisation referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection in relation to any
information ought to prevail in the interests of the data subjects concerned or any
other individuals and by regulations so declares, then, while the regulations are in
force, the said paragraph (a) shall not apply as respects the provision or rule of
law concerned and accordingly section 4 of this Act, as modified as aforesaid,
shall not apply in relation to that information.
Right of rectification or
erasure.

6.—(1) An individual shall, if he so requests in writing a data controller who keeps personal
data relating to him, be entitled to have rectified or, where appropriate, erased any such data in
relation to which there has been a contravention by the data controller of section 2 (1) of this
Act; and the data controller shall comply with the request as soon as may be and in any event
not more than 40 days after it has been given or sent to him:
Provided that the data controller shall, as respects data that are inaccurate or not kept up to
date, be deemed—
(a) to have complied with the request if he supplements the data with a statement (to the
terms of which the individual has assented) relating to the matters dealt with by the
data, and
(b) if he supplements the data as aforesaid, not to be in contravention of paragraph (b) of
the said section 2 (1).
(2) On compliance by a data controller with a request under subsection (1) of this section, he
shall, as soon as may be and in any event not more than 40 days after the request has been given
or sent to him, notify—
(a) the individual making the request, and
(b) if such compliance materially modifies the data concerned, any person to whom the
data were disclosed during the period of 12 months immediately before the giving
or sending of the request,
of the rectification, erasure or statement concerned.
Duty of care owed by data
controllers and data
processors.

7.—For the purposes of the law of torts and to the extent that that law does not so provide, a
person, being a data controller or a data processor, shall, so far as regards the collection by him
of personal data or information intended for inclusion in such data or his dealing with such data,
owe a duty of care to the data subject concerned:
Provided that, for the purposes only of this section, a data controller shall be deemed to have
complied with the provisions of section 2 (1) (b) of this Act if and so long as the personal data
concerned accurately record data or other information received or obtained by him from the data
subject or a third party and include (and, if the data are disclosed, the disclosure is accompanied
by)—
(a) an indication that the information constituting the data was received or obtained as
aforesaid,
(b) if appropriate, an indication that the data subject has informed the data controller that
he regards the information as inaccurate or not kept up to date, and
(c) any statement with which, pursuant to this Act, the data are supplemented.

Disclosure of personal data

(b) required for the purpose of preventing, detecting or investigating offences,

loss of or damage to property,
(e) required by or under any enactment or by a rule of law or order of a court,

10.—(1) (a) The Commissioner may investigate, or cause to be investigated, whether any of
the provisions of this Act have been, are being or are likely to be contravened
by a data controller or a data processor in relation to an individual either
where the individual complains to him of a contravention of any of those
provisions or he is otherwise of opinion that there may be such a
contravention.
(b) Where a complaint is made to the Commissioner under paragraph (a) of this
subsection, the Commissioner shall—
(i) investigate the complaint or cause it to be investigated, unless he is of
opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious, and

within 21 days from the receipt by him of the notification.
(2) If the Commissioner is of opinion that a person, being a data controller or a data
processor, has contravened or is contravening a provision of this Act (other than a provision the
contravention of which is an offence), the Commissioner may, by notice in writing (referred to
in this Act as an enforcement notice) served on the person, require him to take such steps as are
specified in the notice within such time as may be so specified to comply with the provision
concerned.
(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) of this section, if the Commissioner
is of opinion that a data controller has contravened section 2 (1) of this Act, the relevant
enforcement notice may require him—
(a) to rectify or erase any of the data concerned, or
(b) to supplement the data with such statement relating to the matters dealt with by them

appeal.
(6) If the Commissioner—
(a) by reason of special circumstances, is of opinion that a requirement specified in an
enforcement notice should be complied with urgently, and
(b) includes a statement to that effect in the notice,
subsections (4) (b) and (5) of this section shall not apply in relation to the notice, but the notice

of this Act and shall not require compliance with the requirement before the end of the period of
7 days beginning on the date on which the notice is served.
(7) On compliance by a data controller with a requirement under subsection (3) of this
section, he shall, as soon as may be and in any event not more than 40 days after such
compliance, notify—

transfer of personal data from the State to a place outside the State.
(2) The Commissioner, when considering whether to prohibit a proposed transfer of personal
data from the State to a place in a state bound by the Convention, shall have regard to the
provisions of Article 12 of the Convention.
(3) The Commissioner shall not prohibit a proposed transfer of personal data from the State
to a place outside the State unless he is of opinion that the transfer would, if the place were in a
state bound by the Convention, be likely to lead to a contravention of the basic principles for
data protection set out in Chapter II of the Convention.
(4) In determining whether to prohibit a transfer of personal data under this section, the
Commissioner shall also consider whether the transfer would be likely to cause damage or
distress to any person and have regard to the desirability of facilitating international transfers of
data.
(5) A prohibition under subsection (1) of this section shall be effected by the service of a
notice (referred to in this Act as a prohibition notice) on the person proposing to transfer the
data concerned.

categories of data controllers to prepare codes of practice to be complied with by those
categories in dealing with personal data.

encourage its dissemination to the data controllers concerned.

be, notify in writing the person applying for registration of the refusal and the notification

files, a list of which will be deposited. In this list it shall not include, however, categories of

b. that it will also apply this convention to information relating to groups of persons,
associations, foundations, companies, corporations and any other bodies consisting directly or

provided for in sub-paragraph 2.b or c above may give notice in the said declaration that such
extensions shall apply only to certain categories of personal data files, a list of which will be
deposited.
4. Any Party which has excluded certain categories of automated personal data files by a
declaration provided for in sub-paragraph 2.a above may not claim the application of this
convention to such categories by a Party which has not excluded them.
5. Likewise, a Party which has not made one or other of the extensions provided for in subparagraphs 2.b or c above may not claim the application of this convention on these points with
respect to a Party which has made such extensions.
6. The declarations provided for in paragraph 2 above shall take effect from the moment of
the entry into force of the convention with regard to the State which has made them if they have
been made at the time of signature or deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance,
approval or accession, or three months after their receipt by the Secretary General of the
Council of Europe if they have been made at any later time. These declarations may be
withdrawn, in whole or in part, by a notification addressed to the Secretary General of the
