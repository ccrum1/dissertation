OBLIGATIONS OF DATA FIDUCIARY

Grounds for processing digital personal data
A person may process the personal data of a Data Principal only in
accordance with the provisions of this Act and Rules made thereunder, for a
lawful purpose for which the Data Principal has given or is deemed to have
given her consent in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
For the purpose of this Act, “lawful purpose” means any purpose which is not
expressly forbidden by law.

6.

Notice
(1)
On or before requesting a Data Principal for her consent, a Data
Fiduciary shall give to the Data Principal an itemised notice in clear and plain
language containing a description of personal data sought to be collected by
the Data Fiduciary and the purpose of processing of such personal data.
(2)
Where a Data Principal has given her consent to the processing of her
personal data before the commencement of this Act, the Data Fiduciary must
give to the Data Principal an itemised notice in clear and plain language
containing a description of personal data of the Data Principal collected by the
Data Fiduciary and the purpose for which such personal data has been
processed, as soon as it is reasonably practicable.
For the purpose of this section:

(a) “notice” can be a separate document, or an electronic form, or a part of
the same document in or through which personal data is sought to be
collected, or in such other form as may be prescribed.
(b) “itemised” means presented as a list of individual items.
Illustration: ‘A’ contacts a bank to open a regular savings account. The bank
asks ‘A’ to furnish photocopies of proof of address and identity for KYC
formalities. Before collecting the photocopies, the bank should give notice to ‘A’
stating that the purpose of obtaining the photocopies is completion of KYC
formalities. The notice need not be a separate document. It can be printed on the
form used for opening the savings bank account.
(3)
The Data Fiduciary shall give the Data Principal the option to access
the information referred to in sub-sections (1) and (2) in English or any
language specified in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.
7.

Consent
(1)
Consent of the Data Principal means any freely given, specific,
informed and unambiguous indication of the Data Principal's wishes by which
the Data Principal, by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the
processing of her personal data for the specified purpose.
For the purpose of this sub-section, “specified purpose” means the purpose
mentioned in the notice given by the Data Fiduciary to the Data Principal in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(2)
Any part of consent referred in sub-section (1) which constitutes an
infringement of provisions of this Act shall be invalid to the extent of such
infringement.
Illustration: ‘A’ enters into a contract with ‘B’ to provide a service ‘X’ to ‘B’. As
part of the contract, ‘B’ consents to: (a) processing of her personal data by ‘A’,
and (b) waive her right to file a complaint with the Board under the provisions
of this Act. Part (b) of the consent by which ‘B’ has agreed to waive her right
shall be considered invalid.
(3)
Every request for consent under the provisions of this Act shall be
presented to the Data Principal in a clear and plain language, along with the
contact details of a Data Protection Officer, where applicable, or of any other
person authorised by the Data Fiduciary to respond to any communication
from the Data Principal for the purpose of exercise of her rights under the
provisions of this Act. The Data Fiduciary shall give to the Data Principal the


option to access such request for consent in English or any language
specified in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India.
(4)
Where consent given by the Data Principal is the basis of processing of
personal data, the Data Principal shall have the right to withdraw her consent
at any time. The consequences of such withdrawal shall be borne by such
Data Principal. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of
processing of the personal data based on consent before its withdrawal. The
ease of such withdrawal shall be comparable to the ease with which consent
may be given.
Illustration: ‘A’ enters into a contract with ‘B’ to provide a service ‘X’ to ‘B’. As
part of the contract, ‘B’ consents to processing of her personal data by ‘A’. If
‘B’ withdraws her consent to processing of her personal data, ‘A’ may stop
offering the service ‘X’ to ‘B’.
(5)
If a Data Principal withdraws her consent to the processing of personal
data under sub-section (4), the Data Fiduciary shall, within a reasonable time,
cease and cause its Data Processors to cease processing of the personal
data of such Data Principal unless such processing without the Data
Principal’s consent is required or authorised under the provisions of this Act or
any other law.
Illustration: ‘A’ subscribes to an e-mail and SMS-based sales notification
service operated by ‘B’. As part of the subscription contract, ‘A’ shares her
personal data including mobile number and e-mail ID with ‘B’ which shares it
further with ‘C’, a Data Processor for the purpose of sending alerts to ‘A’ via email and SMS. If ‘A’ withdraws her consent to processing of her personal
data, ‘B’ shall stop and cause ‘C’ to stop processing the personal data of ‘A’.
(6)
The Data Principal may give, manage, review or withdraw her consent
to the Data Fiduciary through a Consent Manager.
For the purpose of this section, a "Consent Manager" is a Data Fiduciary
which enables a Data Principal to give, manage, review and withdraw her
consent through an accessible, transparent and interoperable platform.
(7)
The Consent Manager specified in this section shall be an entity that is
accountable to the Data Principal and acts on behalf of the Data Principal.
Every Consent Manager shall be registered with the Board in such manner
and subject to such technical, operational, financial and other conditions as
may be prescribed.



(8)
The performance of any contract already concluded between a Data
Fiduciary and a Data Principal shall not be made conditional on the consent to
the processing of any personal data not necessary for that purpose.
Illustration: If ‘A’ enters into a contract with ‘B’ to provide a service ‘X’ to ‘B’
then ‘A’ shall not deny to provide service ‘X’ to ‘B’ on B’s refusal to give
consent for collection of additional personal data which is not necessary for
the purpose of providing service ‘X’.
(9)
Where consent given by the Data Principal is the basis of processing of
personal data and a question arises in this regard in a proceeding, the Data
Fiduciary shall be obliged to prove that a notice was given by the Data
Fiduciary to the Data Principal and consent was given by the Data Principal to
the Data Fiduciary in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

c. the reasonable expectations of the Data Principal having regard to the context
of the processing.

9.

General obligations of Data Fiduciary
(1)
A Data Fiduciary shall, irrespective of any agreement to the contrary, or
non-compliance of a Data Principal with her duties specified in this Act, be
responsible for complying with the provisions of this Act in respect of any
processing undertaken by it or on its behalf by a Data Processor or another
Data Fiduciary.
(2)
A Data Fiduciary shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal
data processed by or on behalf of the Data Fiduciary is accurate and
complete, if the personal data:
(a)
is likely to be used by the Data Fiduciary to make a decision
that affects the Data Principal to whom the personal data relates; or
(b)
is likely to be disclosed by the Data Fiduciary to another Data
Fiduciary.
Illustration: ‘A’ has instructed her mobile service provider ‘B’ to mail physical
copies of monthly bills to her postal address. Upon a change in her postal
address, ‘A’ duly informs ‘B’ of her new postal address and completes
necessary KYC formalities. ‘B’ should ensure that the postal address of ‘A’ is
updated accurately in its records.
(3)
A Data Fiduciary shall implement appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure effective adherence with the provisions of
this Act.
(4)
Every Data Fiduciary and Data Processor shall protect personal data in

Principal, in such form and manner as may be prescribed.



For the purpose of this section “affected Data Principal” means any Data
Principal to whom any personal data affected by a personal data breach
relates.
(6)
A Data Fiduciary must cease to retain personal data, or remove the
means by which the personal data can be associated with particular Data
Principals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that:
(a)
the purpose for which such personal data was collected is no
longer being served by its retention; and
(b)

retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.

Illustration (A): ‘A’ creates an account on ‘X’, a Social Media Platform. As
part of the process of creating the account, ‘A’ shares her personal data with
‘X’. After three months, ‘A’ deletes the account. Once ‘A’ deletes the account,
‘X’ must stop retaining the personal data of ‘A’ or remove the means by which
the personal data of ‘A’ can be associated with ‘A’.
Illustration (B): ‘A’ opens a savings account with a bank. As part of KYC
formalities, ‘A’ shares her personal data with the bank. After six months, ‘A’
closes the savings account with the bank. As per KYC rules, the bank is
required to retain personal data for a period beyond six months. In this case,
the bank may retain ‘A’s’ personal data for the period prescribed in KYC Rules
because such retention is necessary for a legal purpose.
(7)
Every Data Fiduciary shall publish, in such manner as may be
prescribed, the business contact information of a Data Protection Officer, if
applicable, or a person who is able to answer on behalf of the Data Fiduciary,

on its behalf, only under a valid contract. Such Data Processor may, if
permitted under its contract with the Data Fiduciary, further engage, appoint,
use, or involve another Data Processor in processing personal data only
under a valid contract.

Process to be followed by the Board to ensure compliance with
the provisions of the Act

possible, function as a digital office and employ such techno-legal measures
as may be prescribed.
(2)
The Board may, on receipt of a complaint made by an affected person
or on a reference made to it by the Central Government or a State
Government or in compliance with the directions of any court or in case of
non-compliance with section 16 of this Act by a Data Principal, take action in
accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(3)
The Board may authorise conduct of proceedings relating to
complaints, by individual Members or groups of Members.

The Board shall first determine whether there are sufficient grounds to
proceed with an inquiry. In case the Board determines that there are
insufficient grounds, it may, for reasons recorded in writing, close such
proceeding.
(5)
In case the Board determines that there are sufficient grounds to
proceed with inquiry, it may, for reasons recorded in writing, inquire into the


affairs of any person for ascertaining whether such person is complying with
or has complied with the provisions of this Act.
(6)
The Board shall conduct such inquiry following the principles of natural
justice including giving reasonable opportunity of being heard and shall record
reasons for its actions during the course of such inquiry.
(7)
For the purpose of conduct of inquiry under this section, the Board shall
have powers to summon and enforce the attendance of persons, examine
them on oath and inspect any data, book, document, register, books of
account or any other document.
(8)
Inquiry under this section shall be completed at the earliest. The Board
or its officers shall not prevent access to any premises or take into custody
any equipment or any item that may adversely affect the day-to-day
functioning of a person.
(9)
The Board may require the services of any police officer or any officer
of the Central Government or a State Government to assist it for the purposes
of this section and it shall be the duty of every such officer to comply with
such requisition.
(10) During the course of the inquiry if the Board considers it necessary for
preventing non-compliance with the provisions of this Act, it may, for reasons
to be recorded in writing, issue interim orders after giving the concerned
persons a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
(11) On conclusion of the inquiry and after giving the concerned persons a
reasonable opportunity of being heard, if the Board determines that noncompliance by a person is not significant, it may, for reasons recorded in
writing, close such inquiry. If the Board determines that the non-compliance
by the person is significant, it shall proceed in accordance with section 25 of
this Act.
(12) At any stage after receipt of a complaint, if the Board determines that
the complaint is devoid of merit, it may issue a warning or impose costs on the
complainant.
(13) Every person shall be bound by the orders of the Board. Every order
made by the Board shall be enforced by it as if it were a decree made by a
Civil Court. For the purpose of this sub-section, the Board shall have all the
powers of a Civil Court as provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

Review and Appeal


(1)

larger than the group which held proceedings in a matter under section 21, on
a representation made to it, or on its own, and for reasons to be recorded in
writing, modify, suspend, withdraw or cancel any order issued under the
provisions of this Act and in doing so, may impose such conditions as it may
deem fit, subject to which the modification, suspension, withdrawal or
cancellation shall have effect.

action in respect of any matter under the provisions of this Act and no
injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any
action taken under the provisions of this Act.

Alternate Dispute Resolution

If the Board is of the opinion that any complaint may more appropriately be resolved
by mediation or other process of dispute resolution, the Board may direct the
concerned parties to attempt resolution of the dispute through mediation by a body
or group of persons designated by the Board or such other process as the Board
may consider fit.
24.

Voluntary Undertaking
(1)
The Board may accept a voluntary undertaking in respect of any matter

(3)
The Board may, after accepting the voluntary undertaking and with the
agreement of the person who gave the voluntary undertaking vary the terms
included in the voluntary undertaking. Acceptance of the voluntary
undertaking by the Board shall constitute a bar on proceedings under the
provisions of this Act as regards the contents of the voluntary undertaking,
except in cases covered by sub-section (4).

undertaking accepted by the Board, the Board may, after giving such person,
